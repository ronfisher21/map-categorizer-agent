      "Everything is great! It really matches the rating given at Google map. Food quality is excellent, incl the draft beers (highly recommended) and the salad (5 star), not to mention the meat quality. The service personnel is patient to communicate with us as we don’t speak Japanese at all. We were recommended what is good and fit us (instead of what is most expensive and the more the better). It’s a new place so the environment is nice and cozy. V spacey. We are so glad that we made the right choice!",
      "We had the set menu came with a bunch of different wagyu cuts, some were grilled by the staff, some we grilled ourselves.\n\nThe plum wine was absolutely incredible, would highly recommend to everyone.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy, ceilings are low, so watch out for your heads!",
      "3 people (one who doesn’t yakiniku) for ¥16,000. The boys say it was absolutely delish. I don’t eat beef but had kimchi, cold noodles ( so so so good) and the seaweed soup. English menu available & staff were very friendly. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time.",
      "I recently visited this new spot in Ebisu, and I must say it offers high-quality meat at a very reasonable price, especially considering the area. The service was excellent, and I’m already looking forward to my next visit!",
      "Was recommended to visit this place by a close friend and sampled some of the best cuts of beef I have ever tasted. Everything was high in quality and the service by the staff was impeccable. Without a doubt, One of my favorite meal in Tokyo."

      "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nI absolutely loved my visit to RUMBLE CRUMBLE 渋谷本店! From the moment I walked in, the shop’s charm and attention to detail stood out — it’s a beautifully curated space in the heart of Shibuya/Harajuku that’s perfect for both casual treats and special occasions.\n\nThe cookies here are truly exceptional. They have this amazing contrast of textures — crisp and golden on the outside, yet soft and moist inside — which immediately tells you these aren’t your average sweets. The flavours are rich but balanced, and you can really taste the high-quality ingredients in every bite. People rave online about how these cookies are worth tracking down even outside the usual snack spots, and I completely agree!  ￼\n\nWhat’s great is that the shop carries a wide variety of options, including classic cookies and the more indulgent cookie cakes that you can only get in-store. They’re perfect for gifts or sharing, and make for irresistibly delicious souvenirs after a day exploring Tokyo.  ￼\n\nAnother amazing thing I learned is that this brand has serious creative roots — crafted with care and originally gaining popularity online for being hard to get — so finally having a physical store where you can taste them fresh is a real treat.  ￼\n\nFriendly service, great ambience, and some of the best cookies I’ve ever had in Tokyo. Whether you’re a local or visiting from overseas, this place deserves every one of its five stars!",
      "Nice place for good and fresh cookies they are freshly made and not too sweet. They have so many different flavours for each taste",
      "Great atmosphere and really pretty shop but the cookies are overpriced and just not that good unfortunately. I got a classic chocolate chip and though it was warm, it had little to no flavor and then left a bad after taste. I hope the store improves their recipes.",
      "This shop is a charming place to buy cookies. The staff member was friendly and provided great recommendations. Although the cookies are a bit pricey, it’s clear that they are freshly baked and have a homemade quality. You can definitely tell the difference compared to mass-produced cookies, and this shop stands out.",
      "The variations of cookies give you a lot of choices. The staff are friendly and very helpful, and they can recommend what cookies to choose if you have trouble picking what to get. The price I think is a bit steep for what it is- the cookies are delicious, but still overpriced for a cookie. They are great as a nice gift, but I probably wouldn't be buying them for myself."

      "Oishi Park, Kawaguchi Lake is a very beautiful park and one of the best places to see Mount Fuji clearly. On a good day, the Fuji view from here is really amazing and very close.\n\nEven without Mount Fuji view, this park is still very beautiful. There are many flowers and plants, depending on the season, so it’s nice just to walk around and enjoy the colors and nature.\n\nThere are also some restaurants and cafes in the park area, so you can sit, eat, or drink while enjoying the view. Quite relaxing.\n\nI really recommend coming here for sunrise. Mount Fuji looks very beautiful with the orange sunshine, the atmosphere feels calm and special. Early morning, cold a bit, but totally worth it.\n\nIf you visit Kawaguchi Lake, Oishi Park is a place you should not miss.",
      "One of the Most Breathtaking Views of Mt. Fuji! A Must-Visit in Kawaguchiko!\n\nOishi Park is truly one of the most stunning and peaceful places I have ever visited. Located along the shores of Lake Kawaguchiko, the park offers a perfect, postcard-worthy view of Mt. Fuji—so clear and majestic that it almost feels unreal.\n\nThe combination of the lake, seasonal flowers, and Fuji in the background creates scenery that changes beautifully throughout the year. Whether it’s the vibrant lavender fields in summer, the bright kochia bushes in autumn, or the crisp, clear winter views, every season has its own magic here.\n\nThe park is clean, spacious, and extremely well-maintained. Walking through the flower-lined paths is relaxing and perfect for photography lovers. It’s one of those rare places where you can simply sit, breathe, and enjoy nature without any rush.\n\nWhat I loved most is how accessible and visitor-friendly it is—plenty of benches, cute cafés and souvenir shops nearby, and wide-open spaces to explore at your own pace.\n\nIf you’re visiting Kawaguchiko, Oishi Park is absolutely a must-visit location. The view of Mt. Fuji from here is one of the best you’ll ever see, and the entire atmosphere is peaceful, refreshing, and unforgettable. I left with so many beautiful photos and an even more beautiful memory.",
      "📍 Oishi Park 大石公園\n@ Kawaguchiko, Yamanashi 🇯🇵\n\nWe first visited Oishi Park (大石公園) on 18 November 2025 around 4:15pm. The sunset light over Lake Kawaguchi was warm and gentle, although a cloud covered the top of Mount Fuji 🗻. The lower half of Fuji was still visible, giving the scene a soft, dramatic mood. The lakeside walkway, flower beds, and open viewing area made it a peaceful place to unwind before evening.\n\nThe free parking beside the park is very convenient, and it’s only a short stroll to the lake viewpoint, café, and small shops.\n\nOn the second day in the morning, we visited Oishi Park again — and this time, the weather was clear enough that we finally captured Mount Fuji in full view. The crisp morning air, calm lake surface, and bright natural light created the perfect scene. Seeing Fuji clearly after the previous day’s cloud cover made the moment extra special.\n\nA relaxing lakeside park with stunning Fuji views — beautiful during sunset, and absolutely rewarding when Fuji appears clearly on a bright morning. 🗻🌅✨",
      "Oishi Park is a beautiful and well-maintained place with stunning views of Mount Fuji and Lake Kawaguchiko. The scenery is peaceful, clean, and perfect for a relaxing walk or taking photos at any time of day.\n\nFor getting around the Kawaguchiko area, I highly recommend buying the one-day pass for the sightseeing bus. It allows unlimited hop-on hop-off rides and makes it easy to explore popular spots along the Red Line, Green Line, and Blue Line.\n\nAnother great option is renting a bicycle. Many rental shops offer bikes for around 2,000 yen per day, which is perfect if you want to explore the area at a slower, more flexible pace.",
      "Oishi Park is one of the most beautiful spots around Lake Kawaguchi to enjoy a clear and unobstructed view of Mount Fuji. The park is very well maintained with colorful seasonal flowers that change throughout the year, making it perfect for photography and a relaxing stroll.\n\nThe walking paths are clean and easy to explore, with benches where you can sit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. There are also small shops and cafes nearby selling local snacks, souvenirs, and ice cream, which is great for a short break while enjoying the scenery.\n\nThis place is especially stunning on a clear day when Mount Fuji appears in full view behind the flower fields — truly postcard-worthy. Highly recommended for nature lovers, photographers, and anyone visiting the Kawaguchiko area.\n\nA must-visit spot if you want one of the best Mount Fuji views in Japan!"

      "Best place to see a mountain full of cherry blossom. Lovely mountain with great scenery. The place is very clean and very well taken care. There are restaurants and cafe in the area with great view. Best to ride the ropeway going up and just walk down later when going home. Bus is another option.",

      "Mesmerizing and breathtaking place. One of the best places in Japan for Sakura (Cherry blossom viewing). Hiking in Mount Yoshino is an amazing experience. It is nice to have food at the viewpoint by watching these beautiful Cherry blossom.\n- 09-Apr-2025",
      "Undoubtedly one of the best places in Japan for sakura viewing. Went there today on 6th April, 2025. All photos were captured on that day.\nAfter arriving at Yoshino station from Osaka Abenobashi, we took the shuttle bus to Nakasenbon (15-20 mints ride) and walked till the Hanayaguru observatory (1.5 Km from Nakasenbon bus point) to have an unobstructed view of the entire Yoshino town all the way till the Kinpunsen ji Temple. However, the cherry blossoms in the Kamisenbon area around the viewpoint were just opening. Walked down the mountain to the rail station thereafter in around 2 hours (4.5 Km) while soaking in all the superb views."

      "As good as I remembered it 9 years ago. They have branded t-shirts now, more staff and a better system for getting into the restaurant. But the quality is still there. We got there around 6pm and the line wasn’t too bad.\n\nJuicy katsu, delicious sweet sauce, perfect katsudon runny egg. Just wonderfully made and comfort food Katsudon.\n\nCash is ideal and there is only one item on the menu, it is pricy for what it is but totally worth it.",
      "Katsudon-ya Zuicho is a must every time I visit Tokyo! Their katsudon is just perfect. Not too soggy, with crispy pork, perfectly cooked eggs, and a nicely balanced sweet-salty sauce. The place is small with limited seating, so you’ll probably have to wait in line, but it’s totally worth it.",
      "Waited at least an hour prior to opening, and noticed only tourists are lining up which is not a good sign. No interaction with the waitress who serves the food as they all seems in bad mood. Only the person who took our order outside during the lineup was nice and welcoming. The cutlet was thin and either poorly trimmed or wasn’t the best quality because cannot even swallow the greasy parts like other katsudon place. Food is very average and not as impressive as per the reviews. Personally find this place is overhyped",
      "JPY 1500 for a bowl of Katstudong with a small bottle of Sapporo.\n\nI was at the bar counter observing the kitchen's operation first hand.\nWith a max of 8-seating space, each client spent approx 15 mins of eating then the staff gave a signal to bring new clients in and lining up waiting for me to leave so I had to finish my beer very instantly.  Cask only by the way!\n\nThe queue was managed very efficiently. Photo of cooking and staff is prohibited.\n\nIt was a 40-min queue with max of 15 minutes each individual customer was allowed to finish their food before getting checked.\n\nMy advice 👇\nIf you expect to enjoy the atmosphere and relaxing or chatting with your friends, look away.\n\nFor a solo or a couple, the Katstudong is very good, definitely worth queuing.",
      "The food was great, especially the sauce on top. It combined the sweetness from the sauce perfectly well with the saltiness from the katsu and the rice balanced the entire meal superbly.\n\nHowever, I would imagine that you can find something quite similar without having to stand in line for nearly an hour. During our meal there were seats free, because the people that were first in line outnumbered the number of available seats. I would suggest to actually let smaller companies to pass ahead then as that would speed up the queueing.\nSo with the considerable wait in mind I feel like 4 is as high as I will be able to give."

      "We love dogs! I had high expectations of this temple before visiting. Very happy to see the dog sign and the cute little shrine. However the shop in the shed (not the one inside) left a bad taste at the end. I picked 2 lucky charms which had a clear sign of “1000 yen” next to the box and handed 2000 yen, the lady said I need to pay 3000, because the little dog charm attached is charged for 500 yen separately. She asked if I wanted the doggie charms taken off. It’s such an obvious con towards tourists… we walked away immediately… first time to experience this in Japan. :(",

      "The Beauty of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n​A Vertical Cathedral: The towering stalks of bamboo create a sense of infinite verticality. In the second image, looking up toward the sky, the interlocking canopy filters the sunlight, creating a \"Komorebi\" effect—where light dances through the leaves like a natural stained-glass window.\n​A Palette of Natural Tones: There is a beautiful contrast between the cool, silver-green hues of the bamboo culms and the warm, earthy browns of the traditional \"Take-gaki\" (bamboo branch fences). These fences don't just mark a path; they ground the ethereal forest in Japanese craftsmanship and history.\n​The Sound of Silence (and Movement): Even in a still photo, you can almost hear the \"clacking\" of the stalks and the rustling leaves. The third image, showing visitors wandering through the path, highlights the scale of the grove—making the humans look small against the majesty of nature.\n​A Path of Contemplation: The winding dirt paths and the rhythmic patterns of the bamboo create a meditative atmosphere. It is a place where the bustling modern world (represented by the tourists) meets an ancient, towering stillness that feels frozen in time.",
      "Visiting Arashiyama Bamboo Forest was one of those Kyoto moments that really stayed with me. Walking between the towering bamboo felt surreal, almost like stepping into another world where everything slows down. The way the light filters through the tall green stalks and the soft sound of the bamboo swaying in the wind creates a calm, almost meditative atmosphere that’s hard to find anywhere else.\n\nI went early in the morning, which made a huge difference. It was quieter, cooler, and felt more peaceful before the crowds arrived. Taking my time along the path, I found myself just looking up, breathing it all in, and appreciating how simple yet powerful the scenery is. The walk itself isn’t very long, but it doesn’t need to be — the experience is more about the feeling than the distance.\n\nWhat I loved most is how close it is to other beautiful spots. After the bamboo forest, wandering around Arashiyama, crossing Togetsukyo Bridge, and grabbing a coffee nearby made the whole area feel like a perfect day out. Yes, it gets busy later on, but even then, the bamboo forest still feels special. It’s one of those places that reminds you why Kyoto is so unforgettable and why slowing down while traveling really matters.",
      "Arashiyama Bamboo Forest Review (Expert Traveler Insight)\n\nIf you want to know what silence looks like, open the photos first. This is one of those rare places where the pictures tell half the story — and the experience tells the rest. As an experienced traveler and detailed reviewer, I can confidently say Arashiyama Bamboo Forest stands among the most breathtaking natural walks I’ve ever taken.\n\nThis forest isn’t just famous — it deserves the hype. The towering bamboo creates a cathedral-like canopy that feels peaceful, almost spiritual. But here’s the real insider tip: take a rickshaw. Yes, it sounds touristy, but it’s actually the smartest way to explore. Your guide brings you through special inner routes that the general public cannot access, helping you avoid the crowds entirely. They also take incredible photos for you — shots you simply cannot get on your own.\n\nBeyond the forest, the surrounding market area, fall colors, and side streets add even more to the experience. Plan for at least 4–6 hours to enjoy it without rushing, and make sure you dress for the weather as it can feel cooler under the bamboo.\n\nThis was one of the most unforgettable parts of our Japan trip — peaceful, iconic, and absolutely worth every minute. Don’t leave Kyoto without experiencing this.",
      "Quite crowded but a beautiful area. It is worthwhile also visiting the Snow Monkey Park as well to round off the trip. Local river is stunning with greater and lesser Egrets and cormorants. Also had fun hiring a kimono and walking around the temples and villages with the red maple leaves. I would say that if you wanted a quieter tranquil bamboo forest the side hike up to Mt Inari near Tori gates was more serene.",
      "Best is to arrive before 10 am due to crowds.\nIf you want to do the train ride 🚂 you should book in advance and the boat ride 🛶 we couldn’t do due to cold weather🥶\n\nYou can walk towards Otagi temple, it’s quite scenic neighborhood and also less crowded. On the way you’ll have coffee/tea spots 🍵 ☕️ see my other reviews to see which one i recommend!"

      "Very good tsukemen restaurant. My friend and I ordered the largest portion of noodles you can probably order in one sitting, and it seems like you can even add more later if you want. The noodles in the middle of the stack were a bit on the colder side, but the dipping sauce was extremely flavorful and made up for it.\n\nThe female staff member in picture who helped us was very kind, and watching the whole team work was honestly impressive. Everyone was professional, efficient, and clearly knew their roles, working together smoothly even in a small, tightly spaced restaurant. The food was great, but seeing how hardworking and dedicated the staff were made the experience even better.",
      "You cannot go wrong ordering the dipping ramen here (tsukemen). Absolutely delicious. You can adjust the thickness/saltiness of the dipping broth with the hot water kettle provided in front of you. The line moves fast. Come 15 min early before opening if you want to avoid it.",
      "Incredible tsukemen at Fūunji in Shinjuku! The rich, savory dipping broth was thick and umami-packed, perfectly paired with chewy noodles. Toppings like tender chashu and a soft-boiled egg added extra depth, and finishing the broth with hot stock was a nice touch. So happy we had this as our last meal before rushing to the airport—risky timing, but totally worth it! Tiny counter-only space with a short queue, but a must-visit for tsukemen lovers.",
      "Authentic little ramen restaurant. Ramen is more delicious than Tsukemen(Dipping noodles)as the soup is a bit too salty for me.\n\nOverall the ramen is not bad but just average quality no surprise.",
      "We accidentaly came to this popular ramen shop. But to our taste buds, it is not good and broth too salty. We don't mind about about the atmosphere, it is small and giving authentic Japanese ramen bar vibes which is good. The service was also okay, there were about 3-4 staff when were there and they seem nice but always on a rush. We came when they just opened and we didn't know it was popular, there were already a line after 15 minutes. There are ony 4 items in the menu, 2 traditional ramen and 2 Tsukumen (dipping noodles).\nThere are 4 of us in the family and each got a ramen and none of us finished! We didn't liked it, as it was too salty. Maybe it is different on some other days? maybe it was the ambiance that made it popular? There are alot of ramen shops around Tokyo, maybe some are not so good, but definitely not too salty."

      "📍 Gotemba Premium Outlets\n御殿場プレミアム・アウトレット @ Shizuoka, Japan 🇯🇵\n\nWe visited Gotemba Premium Outlets on 19 November 2025, and even though I’m not a big fan of shopping, the visit was surprisingly pleasant. The outlet is spacious, clean, and very well-organised, with wide walkways, rest areas, cafés, and plenty of food options.\n\nThe mall is separated into three main zones — West Zone, East Zone, and Hill Zone — each offering different brands and experiences. The layout is easy to navigate, and the walk between zones is comfortable, with clear signage throughout.\n\nThere are plenty of brands to browse, including sportswear, outdoor gear, fashion, lifestyle goods, cosmetics, and premium labels. Sizes were widely available, which is convenient for travellers. Families will appreciate the LEGO store, as well as several kids’ wear shops. It’s also a good place to explore Japan-made brands like Onitsuka (Onitsuka Tiger).\n\nThe parking lot is huge and well-managed, making arrival and departure smooth. Although the outlet is known for its beautiful Mount Fuji views, the weather was cloudy during our visit, so we were unable to see Fuji this time.\n\nA large, organised outlet divided into West, East, and Hill Zones — offering plenty of brands, kids’ stores, LEGO, Japan-made Onitsuka, and a huge parking area. Enjoyable even for non-shoppers. 🛍️⛅✨",
      "A great shopping destination with an amazing view of Mount Fuji on a clear day. There are plenty of shops with a wide variety of brands, and it’s easy to spend half a day here without feeling rushed.\n\nThe outlet is spacious and well laid out, making it comfortable to walk around while shopping. Overall, a nice balance of shopping, dining, and scenery.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you’re in the area and want to shop with a Mt Fuji backdrop. 🗻🛍️",
      "It's outlet mall. I just stopped by one part to buy a shoes, so I didn't check them all, but it seems like so huge. Anyway you can see the Fuji mountain from here and can shop. I think if you want to take a look all area then you may need whole one day.",
      "This mall is one of the best outlet malls. It’s huge with more than two hundred stores including luxury brands. The luxury brands are a lot cheaper than other outlets which is why this mall is so popular. Since the mall is huge, I’d recommend getting a map for your shopping direction. I would say one day is not enough for this mall.\nMoreover, there is an amazing view of Mount Fuji. You can see it clearly from the mall.\nThere is a lot of parking if you plan to drive there. It was easy to find a parking spot even though I got there in the afternoon.",
      "A massive, beautiful mall with tons of stores—from high-end to casual—and fantastic sales. The shopping is great, but the view of Mount Fuji is unforgettable!\n\nWe arrived around 2 PM on a clear day and got perfect, bright photos of the mountain with no clouds. Do bring your passport for tax-free savings!"

      "We hopped on the 白馬岩岳ゴンドラリフト at the ノア山麓駅 during our stay in Hakuba, and it turned out to be one of those simple delights you don’t expect but absolutely enjoy. The station at the base feels cozy and modern, with friendly staff helping us load our bikes and gear for the ride.\n\nAs the gondola climbed, we were treated to sweeping views of pine forests, rolling valleys, and distant snow-capped peaks. It’s quiet and smooth, offering a moment to breathe in the alpine air and take in the calm beauty of the area. We went during a clear day, and those mountain vistas—pristine, green, and vast—felt like a postcard come to life.\n\nAt the top, the platform offers great vantage points, easy trails, and plenty of spots to pause, stretch, or snap photos. We didn’t ride bikes this time, but watching others cycle down the slopes below added a fun energy to the experience.\n\nThe ride itself isn’t long—maybe 10–15 minutes—but it’s enough to lift your spirits and connect you to Hakuba’s dramatic mountain landscape. It’s a perfect balance of convenience and natural beauty, making it a must-do for anyone staying at the foot of Mount Iwatake.",
      "The view from the top is absolutely beautiful, but you have to take a cable car to get there. It was raining on the day I went, so I didn't get to see much of the view.",
      "A nice gondola ride up to the peak of Iwatake. At the top there’s a restaurant, cafe, and dog park plus the start of a bunch of ski slopes. I went around 11am and it was packed. Gave up on the cafe. Nice views and a scary ride up and down made the 2,400¥ round trip worth it.",
      "Good place so beautiful on the top of mountain have a lot of activities",
      "Best gondola in Hakuba valley, good views on way up until we were in the cloud."

      "A historic station that has coin lockers and tourist information center that provides bicycle rental which I highly recommend. During the all night odori days mid-august, there are early morning trains you can take to Mino-Ota direction. Everyone managed to board. However, you may want to leave the festival just a bit earlier if you really need to sit or sleep during the train ride after a long and engaging night.",

In addition to being a train station, it features a welcoming café where you may unwind or even rent bicycles to explore the charming town.

Additionally, the station is the starting point for two bus routes that conveniently link to important locations in Gujo Hachiman, particularly Jokamachi Plaza. It is a peaceful, practical, and friendly location that makes visiting this old town more enjoyable.",

      "Beautiful temple! It’s a great area to visit and not far from Nagano Station. You can catch bus number 1 from the front of the station. There’s plenty of local food and souvenirs available. Don’t miss out on the Oyaki and Apple Pie\n\nthey are Nagano’s famous specialties",
      "This is the most extraordinary Buddhist temple I have ever visited.\nAs soon as I checked into my hotel, I went for a walk around the city and eventually reached this temple. The moment I arrived, I was enveloped by an overwhelming feeling of happiness — happiness of the highest kind. It was simply indescribable, unlike anything I have ever felt before. Such beauty and such purity.\n\nI attended the morning services every day during my stay in Nagano. They were incredibly beautiful and deeply moving. I felt that I came into contact with something beyond words.\n\nDuring the services, I met wonderful people who gently guided me and explained what to do. I received a morning blessing from the o-jōsama, when he touches you with prayer beads. It is believed that this touch can replace many hours of spiritual practice, as he passes on his accumulated merit to you.\n\nPlease take the time to read about this temple — it is truly remarkable. You can feel the power of prayer there, along with the beauty of this world in its purest form.\n\nIt was here that I decided to begin collecting temple stamps (goshuin). I bought my first goshuin book at this temple, as well as several amulets for my loved ones.",
      "Went here as an unplanned visit after arriving in Nagano and being told that the snow monkeys were not in the onsen after arriving at Nagano Station. It turned out to be a wonderful surprise, and the Zenkōji temple is definitely well worth a visit. Went in the afternoon around 2pm just as the sun was going down, which gave a special light to the area. There is both an element of gravitas as a place of worship and a memorial site. Several Japanese locals visited to pay religious respects, including many elderly Japanese citizens who likely have familial ties to the place.\nThe grounds are serene and well maintained and the walk up the cobblestoned path feels almost like a pilgrimage.\n\nA lot of locals walk and carry dogs in prams. A pitbull in a pram/dress, a manicured sausage dog with knitted hats. A husky in a full dress. Many locals in kimono. The foodstalls felt a bit out of place on the walk up the hill, but the other stores selling prayer materials and small souvenirs did feel vibrant and not too heavily commercialized.\n\nNovember is a good time of year to go. The Japanese maples start to turn red, the crowds are too great and the temperature is crisp. It felt like a very authentic visit and one I would highly recommend.",
      "It is a very beautiful temple, the experience of going through the dark tunnel was something I would  remember by.\n\nA place for enlightenment\nIn the pitch-black tunnel below Zenkoji's Main Hall, we come to realize that all people are completely equal.\nWhile groping in the darkness for the key to Paradise, free yourself of worldly thoughts, engage in self-reflection and even experience a spiritual awakening.",
      "Visitors are allowed to go inside the temple. It was a good experience.\nThe shopping street is worth visiting as well. A few shops selling oyaki which are quite tasty. Other street food was available."

      "📍 Narai-juku 奈良井宿 @ Nagano, Japan 🇯🇵\n\nWe visited Narai-juku on 13 November 2025, and it was one of the most charming and beautifully preserved post towns along the Nakasendo Trail. The nostalgic Edo-period atmosphere is felt immediately — traditional wooden houses, quiet streets, and beautifully preserved architecture that feels like stepping back into old Japan.\n\nThe village is long and enjoyable to walk through, filled with craft shops, small cafes, and local eateries. We tried a bowl of tempura soba, which was warm, flavourful, and perfect for the cool autumn weather. Do note that restaurants can have a waiting time of around 20–30 minutes, especially during peak hours — so plan to spend a bit more time if you intend to dine here.\n\nWe reached Narai-juku by following the signs and crossing the underground trainline from the nearby main parking area. The route was clear, well guided, and easy to follow.\n\nNarai-juku is peaceful and less commercial compared to other post towns, giving it an authentic, relaxed atmosphere. In autumn, the surrounding mountains create a beautiful backdrop, enhancing the charm of the wooden streets.\n\nA wonderful destination for:\n• 🍜 Local dishes like tempura soba\n• 📸 Traditional Edo-style street photos\n• 🛍️ Handcrafted wooden souvenirs\n• 🚶 Scenic village walking\n• 🍡 Local snacks\n• 🏯 Experiencing historical Nakasendo culture\n\nOverall, Narai-juku is a must-visit — calm, scenic, and full of old-town character. Just be prepared for a 20–30 minute wait if you’re planning to eat here. 🍁🏘️✨",
      "Narai-juku in Nagano is one of the most beautifully preserved post towns along the historic Nakasendo Trail and our visit on 6 December 2025 felt like stepping directly into the Edo period. The moment you enter the village the atmosphere changes. The long street lined with dark wooden houses the quiet rhythm of local life, and the sense of history that lingers in the air create an experience that is both peaceful and deeply nostalgic.\n\nWalking through the town is a pleasure in itself. Each building has been carefully maintained, offering a rare glimpse into Japan’s architectural past. Many small craft shops display traditional wooden items, lacquerware and handmade souvenirs. The village also has several cosy tea houses and cafes where visitors can rest and appreciate the scenery.\n\nWe stopped for a warm bowl of tempura soba, which was rich, comforting, and perfect for the cool autumn afternoon. However, it is worth noting that restaurants in Narai-juku can get busy during peak hours, and waiting around twenty to thirty minutes is quite common. Despite the wait, the food and atmosphere make the experience worthwhile.\n\nReaching the village from the main parking area was easy. Clear signs guide visitors through an underground passage beneath the train line, leading directly to the start of the historic street. The route is simple and well marked.\n\nCompared to other popular post towns, Narai-juku feels more authentic and less commercialized. The surrounding mountains, especially in autumn, create a beautiful backdrop that enhances the charm of the old wooden buildings. For anyone interested in history, traditional craftsmanship, or calm scenic walks, Narai-juku offers a wonderfully preserved piece of old Japan. It is a destination well worth exploring at a slow and thoughtful pace.",
      "It’s about an hour drive from Matsumoto Castle. Historical town with beautiful Edo era architecture.  Well preserved wooden houses.  Lots of restaurants and small cafe along the Main Street. Not many souvenirs shops. Most shops sell Japanese lacquerware.",
      "We stopped by in the afternoon while driving through from Lake Suwa, en route to Nagoya.\nWe enjoyed strolling through this rustic historic town, superbly preserved since the Edo period. The souvenir shops, restaurants and minshuku are worth exploring.\nWe sampled some of the snacks and sake,  and walked along the river and enjoyed stepping onto the timber bridge -Kiso Ohashi\nThis bridge crosses the Narai River, which runs parallel to the main street. Extending 30 meters, it is one of the longest wooden bridges in Japan. It was built quite recently, in the 1990s.\n\nOur only regret is that we were a bit early for the glorious autumn colours as we were there in mid-October.",
      "Wonderful place to visit although the P&P crowd (photo and pee) who stops here between train hours from-to Nagoya and Nagano can make it too touristy certain times of the day. If your schedule allows, stay overnight in one the inns ( we stayed in one right in the middle of town and it was fabulous). This way you can stroll through town during peaceful times in the evening and early morning when everything is closed and quiet. During the day you can enjoy going in and out of the shops and enjoying various snacks. See the place before it turns into a total tourist trap, which it's rapidly headed towards."

      "It was actually my first time trying soba-style tsukemen, and honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect since I’m used to the super thick, heavy ramen broths.\n\nThis was totally different in the best way. The broth is clear and refined, not oily at all, with a really nice hit of yuzu and dried sardines (niboshi).\n\nThe coolest part is that they serve two types of noodles in one bowl: one is thin and smooth like traditional soba, and the other is a thicker, flatter noodle.\n\nSuper chill atmosphere inside too, very clean and peaceful. I didn’t have to wait as I got there when it’s almost closed.",
      "Staff was great and kind. Restaurant looked nice. Noodles were greasy and mediocre, and the soup wasn't clear or full of seafood flavor (both advertised on the site)",
      "I highly recommend this amazing tsukemen restaurant. They use two different types of ramen noodles. The different diameters really create a unique dipping ramen experience. If you order the deluxe bowl, you get chashu, pork belly and shrimp wontons. The pork belly was succulent. I added a dash of chili powder and vinegar for my broth. They have an English written menu to order at the kiosk. Note this place is cash only.",
      "Phenomenal tsukemen here where they serve two different types of noodles in each order. One is white, thinner, and has a little less chew while the other is a thick, yellow, chewier noodle. Both are amazing. The fish and pork dipping broth is amazing and comes with chashu pork that’s been slightly charred with a torch before being served which adds an extra smoky depth to the meat and the broth. A must try for tsukemen lovers.",
      "This restaurant is located around a university and it gets very busy around lunch time, even on a weekday. The lineup wasn’t too long as we waited around 30 mins, and lineups kept on going even after we got inside. You first order the dish you want on a machine; and if you can’t read Japanese, they have an English menu. The server who greeted us was very friendly and was helpful when we had questions. After ordering through the machine and getting the tickets, you can choose your seat and give the tickets to the chef. I highly recommend getting their signature dipping ramen.\n\nThe food came fairly quickly and the chefs were very happy when they gave us our food. The dipping ramen comes in thick or thin noodles, but I think you could ask for just thin or thick (not sure since we couldnt read Japanese). The ramen noodles were made fresh and very chewy, and the broth was so flavorful, yet wasn’t too salty. Make sure to not pour the whole soup inside the noodle bowl, you’re supposed to dip the noodles a bit at a time in the broth.\n\nAfter finishing, the chef let me try the soup with a zist of lemon which was also very refreshing. I had a great experience and highly recommend visiting! The lineups are worth it :)\n\nIG: Ayenomz"

The small wooden shop has a warm, nostalgic atmosphere, with an open kitchen where the chefs prepare each bowl right in front of you. We both ordered the Ajitama Chūka Soba, featuring a fragrant niboshi-shoyu broth, tender chashu, marinated egg, and springy noodles. The flavors were balanced—rich yet clean—and the presentation was simple but elegant. Service was efficient, and ordering by ticket machine was easy. A perfect spot for classic Tokyo-style ramen done with precision and care.",
      "Ramen was excellent. The waiter explained me how everything works. The food was very tasty, price was good and it was quickly prepared. Beware that they only take cash. 10/10",
      "The sister shop of the immensely famous ramen shop Ginza Hachigo\n\nThis ramen shop is most famous for its clear broth tsukemen offering two types of noodles of varying thickness; the noodles are smooth and go well with the clear broth\n\nBut the chasiu is somewhat lackluster in contrast",
      "In a city known for good ramen places, Ramen Katsumoto excels in being one of the best.\n\nGood broth and fresh ingredients prepared by the most expert hands. This is a must try for everyone.\n\nTip for the visitor: you come in, turn to the right and find the machine you order through. Place the money and push the button of your desired dish and add ons. Egg is good, tho most ramen come with egg already.\n\nThere is an english menu for those who need it.\n\nI will surely come again. Thank you Chef.",
      "Perfect place for casual ramen. The ramen was tasty with a generous portion of pork and noodles given. The broth was also perfectly done, not too heavy. Credits to the staff were extremely friendly. As tourists, they immediately greeted us and gave us an English menu and run down on how to order. Much appreciated!"

      "Jimbocho Book Town is a unique and charming district that celebrates the love of books and culture. The streets are lined with countless bookstores, many of them specializing in rare, vintage, and secondhand books, creating a nostalgic and intellectual atmosphere.\n\nWalking through Jimbocho feels peaceful and inspiring, with the quiet charm of old bookshops mixed with cozy cafés and traditional eateries. It’s a wonderful place to wander, browse at your own pace, and discover hidden treasures.\n\nJimbocho Book Town is more than just a shopping area — it’s a cultural experience that reflects Tokyo’s deep appreciation for knowledge, history, and literature. A must-visit for book lovers and anyone seeking a slower, more thoughtful side of the city. 📖✨",
      "Jimbocho is a compact neighborhood with around 150 bookstores, most of them long-established second-hand shops run by the same families for decades. Books spill out onto the sidewalks in wooden crates and metal carts, each with handwritten price tags and category notes. People browse quietly, often standing outside for long minutes, as if the entire district operated on a slower, more thoughtful rhythm.\n\nIt’s not only books. Many shops also sell vinyl records, vintage magazines, and woodblock prints and illustrations displayed directly on the pavement. Several stands offer kokeshi dolls—traditional wooden figurines from northern Japan, originally handcrafted as simple toys but now collected as folk art.\n\nJimbocho feels distinctly analogue and unhurried, a place where Tokyo’s usual pace eases for a moment and the culture of reading and collecting continues in its most authentic form.",
      "I love the vibe here, but despite being a book lover, I struggled to really find anything that had me exploring for hours. Many of the stores are dedicated to older Japanese books which if you’re a collector of those, you’ll be in the right place. Worth a stop if you’re nearby but I wouldn’t go out of my way to go here again.",
      "long street of books and many are by the walkway. neatly arranged. selling old DVDs and vinyls as well. Mostly japanese books",
      "Jimbocho Book Town awakened my inner book lover, making me feel truly alive. The scent of magazines and books lining the streets excites me, while the sight of rare old books and maps resting quietly on the shelves was an unexpected delight."

      "Incredible amount of sellers. A good mix of clothes, shoes, accessories, Japanese goods (old and current), toys, etc. Food trucks too. It's almost overwhelming. You can bargain with some. I got some items below asking. The rule of thumb is to be nice and polite. They may do the same.\nSometimes walking away is good. It gives a moment to reflect, both for you and the seller. At times you will find similar items at a cheaper asking price! Sometimes the seller realizes he will lose the sale will call you back.\nI think it's worth visiting if you like thrifting and finding a treasure rewarding.\nGood luck on your hunt. Dont forget to just have fun browsing even if you leave empty handed. Cheers~",
      "First visit. Loved the place. I was after some old, vintage items, Japanese or non-Japanese so had to go. I was not disappointed. Huge amount of stalls.A mixture and old vintage things, new things and mass produced things. Obviously you get alot of tourists there (I was one) and the prices reflect that, a bit higher than I wanted but I was able to negotiate, don't be embarrassed to ask. It does get VERY busy. Food stalls there, toilets as well. You want the best bargains then get there early. It's a bit of a trek to get there but it is worth it.",
      "Such a treat! There were lines of insanely delicious looking food trucks along the crazy amount of gems from the different vendors. Expect crowds since it’s only open on weekends but do not be deterred by the crowd. Vendors were all so passionate in sharing about their goods. A great time!",
      "We visit this flea market everytime we go to Japan. Over the years, we see more and more vendors but we have also seen the prices of various things go outrageously high.. you can probably still find \"good deals\" but most of them are overpriced. Some foreigners need to realize that just because their currency is stronger, doesn't mean they're getting a good deal. Most sellers here don't have standard pricing and just blurt out prices on a whim (I noticed some charge more if you don't speak Japanese).\n\nStill cool for Vintage/Antique/2nd hand valuables but I prefer to visit different branches of Book off/Mode off/Hard off/Hobby off.",
      "As an American visitor, the Tokyo City Flea Market is massive, must-see experience for thrifters. Size wise it reminds me of the Aquaduct flea market in NY.\nYou'll find an incredible array of unique vintage Japanese items like clothing, kimonos, vintage toys, cameras, and pottery—that you can't easily find in the US.\nKey things to know:\n* Go Early ( 8AM) and Bring Cash. It's huge, so start early for the best finds. Most vendors are cash-only.\n* Bargaining is possible and I personally suggest on doing, but not a given. Unlike some US flea markets, prices can be fixed. Some vendors mark their vintage items considerably high. You can try a simple, polite negotiation, but don't expect deep discounts on every item.\n* Language is manageable: Even if you don't speak Japanese, you can usually get by with pointing, using the phone calculator, and knowing \"how much is this\" (ikura desu ka).\n* Know what you are willing to pay and don't assume every item is a massive steal. I found a Japanese Back to the Future laser disk in mint condition for $14 dollars which I'm going to frame  and some 25 year old Macross kits in like new condition.\n* The Food is Great: Don't skip the food stalls for some authentic Japanese snacks and meals!\n* While at the flea market go ahead and buy an extra suitcase. They're fairly cheap-You're going to need it...\n\nAddendum:\nThis next bit isn't about Tokyo Flea Market itself, but a recent event I needed to write down. I traveled to Japan a few months ago and my biggest regret is that I never got to take my brother with me. As kids growing up we've often talked about going to Japan together and as an adult I placed that trip on hold with him thinking we'd have another chance later on. Since unexpectedly losing him last week, I've learned in the hardest way that life is incredibly precious and the moments we share are not guaranteed.                   Unfortunately I've become so incredibly numb to a mondane, repetitious life, that I've overlooked one of the most important person in my life.\nDon't take the moments you have for granted and if you're doom scrolling right now stop for five minutes and call a loved one, take a trip together, even if it's for a coffe or a burger, please, go do it now. Don't wait.\n\nAlex 1979-2025 \"Greatly missed, never forgotten\"."

      "Best experience ever! I was kindly assisted by a staff who spoke basic english. The eye exam was free (!) and took only 10 mins!\nI opt for basic lenses that slightly change color in the sun and they were ready within an hour. And it's way cheaper than what I pay in Canada. I will definitely recommend! 🩷",
      "Fantastic service and speedy glasses!\n\nThey do speak English and if not they have a translator device to help aid the language barrier.\n\nI had ordered bifocals and it takes at least a week for them to make those special lenses, but they were able to get the glasses back to me within a week. Basic lenses can be made within the hour or day.\n\nThey do offer free eye exams and I tried it, but recently got my eyes checked by my optometrist at home who understands how precise I can be. The eye exam from JINS is basic in this instance, but I found the prescription from my optometrist was sharper and so I went with the prescription versus the JINS exam.\n\nWould highly recommend this if you are looking for affordable glasses and quick turnaround compared to the US.",
      "This is a fantastic place to get prescription glasses . They checked my eyes and prepared reading glasses in half an hour. You pick your own frames , and the type of lenses you want .  I got one pair with standard lenses and one blue light filter lenses.  They speak excellent English . Take your passport and receive the tax off at purchase . Depending on the frame you choose will depend on the price . I paid just over  $200 for two pair .  I chose 1 expensive e frame and one cheaper frame . They ranged from $55 aud to $150 aud .  Excellent service.  Find them just down from  Starbucks and Kanno coffee and gong cha at grandstand Yaesu end of station",
      "It was great experience handing down the best quick service for prescription glasses. The store has many selection to choose from. Nomura speak English very well and patience and help with the selection and able to complete everything within 30 minutes after payment.",
      "Lost my glasses and have one make here. Was rushing for Shinkansen and the friendly staff that is fluent in English tell me overall within an hour. The glasses was ready in 30 mins and self collect at locker with QR code. The eye test is state of the art using dial and quite an experience for me. The cost is also v affordable to my surprise. Walk away a happy man."

      "Very cool location that is not very well known. I went in early December and decided to visit here since the Biwako Valley ropeway was not yet open. The return ticket is around 2000 yen?, which is reasonably price. Just make sure to keep your ticket once you go up since they will ask for the same one when you go down. The ride runs every 15 minutes, and takes about 5 minutes to go up to the mountain top. You can see the entire town, as well as parts of lake Biwa from inside the cable car.\nThere is a temple at the top of the mountain. I believe it used to be part of the Hachimanyama castle ruins. There is also a bathroom facility. If you walk to the left for around 10 minutes, you will reach a lookout point where you can see the entire town below (very beautiful!). There are plenty of hiking tracks that you can take to go down, if you don’t want to take the cable car down.\nThe castle is completely demolished, only a few remnants remain like some stone walls, the moats, some signs that tell you where the castle once stood.\nIf you’re lucky, you might encounter the cats. There were two that I bumped into. Very friendly and let you pet them",
      "Took the cable car to the top to see the hachiman castle ruins. Reasonably priced and frequent services up and down the mountain. Very smooth ride. Friendly and helpful staff. Great views from the top and well worth visiting if you're in Omihachiman. Little gift shop at the entrance to the cable cars and toilets available at the top of the mountain.",
      "Beautiful views and a peaceful ride! Hachiman Ropeway offers a lovely perspective of Omihachiman and the surrounding hills. The ride is short but very scenic, perfect for photos and enjoying nature. Highly recommend for a quick escape from the city.",
      "A small ropeway that takes you to a hill overseeing the whole area around OumiHachiman including the Biwa lake. Astounding views from the top. There's also a neat temple with some Tori and pleasant greenery and butterflies. Totally recommend, we were the only foreign tourists.",
      "Soooo beautiful in the fall around sunset! It felt like a fairytale! There are also a couple of cats roaming around the temple 🐈"

      "The most beautiful zen buddhist garden and temple we have seen so far in Japan. It is amazingly peaceful, with a tea ceremony experience after enjoying a walk through the bamboo forest. 🙏🏻",
      "I thought it is a very big forest but is not go in have a 5-10 walk can be done. But the bamboo quite nice to take photo n it have others nice tree to photo too... Entry normal 400yen and if u want to enjoy a cup of green tea u need to get the 1000yen ticket. Overall is OK.",
      "Lovely little temple with a serene and beautifully designed garden. The bamboo forest is small but gives you a warm feeling. You can have matcha in the garden as well. A bit off the main attraction, so quieter but well worth it.",
      "Our visit to Hokoku-ji Temple was a little bit of a consolation prize (and please know that when I say that, I am not demeaning this absolutely INCREDIBLE temple in ANY way); what I am saying is that, looking at our itinerary and realizing that a day trip to Kyoto (and by extension, the Arashiyama bamboo forest) was just not in the cards, but I still wanted to take my wife, sons, and myself, to see a magical bamboo forest.\n\nThankfully, Kamakura was already on our list of stops, and after learning that Hokoku-ji had a similarly impressive bamboo forest path, visiting here had become a foregone conclusion. Google Maps claims it's a 30-minute walk from Kamakura Station; in reality, it's closer to 20 minutes, but in the summer heat and humidity, it feels more like an hour. Even then, it was worth it.\n\nThere is an extremely modest entry fee to access the temple grounds (I believe it was around ¥500/person, so $3 USD or so), but once you are through the gates, you are almost immediately treated to one of the most gorgeous, verdant emerald cloisters you will ever encounter. Claustrophobic (in a good away), this narrow winding stretch of walkway winds about through the grounds of the temple, eventually terminating with a view of cliffside caves containing statues and shrines, ponds filled with koi, and cool, comforting, quiet, serene shade from the pervasive heat and humidity. It's a short path, but it'll stick with you.\n\nSure, it's a little out of the way, in a semi-remote part of the Kamakura (there is a bus that runs from the station to the temple, so utilize those Suica cards, and save yourself the walk!), but as I mentioned, it's a more than adequate substitute for the overly-trafficked Arashiyama, much closer to Tokyo, and located in a city that has more than enough reasons to visit all by itself. If that's all you're looking to experience, you're in for a treat. But if you're ready to immerse yourself in all that Hokoku-ji has to offer, you'll find so much more here than you might suspect, and you won't want to be anywhere else.",
      "Amazing forest so peaceful and quiet!\nI read that some people were disappointed because it's little, we weren't! It's totally worth it!\nWe took also a matcha in the forest and it was a beautiful experience to do 🍵✨🎍"

Nevertheless, we still managed to have some grilled seafood and beef sticks at one of the shops. Managed to get some Kamakura souvenirs from here as well.",
      "Nice shopping street with various themed cafes such as totoro and animal cafes (please dont go to animal cafes, its abuse!). Lots of specialty shops such as miffy and other things. Good spots to eat too, such as 'vintage island coffee' (great sandwiches). There is also a smoking area inside the building with a red carpet in front.",
      "I am shocked thats there's so little review about this street.\nThere are many streetfoods on this street like grilled skewers, salted cucumber, traditional japanese snacks, drinks including beers, kakigori etc.\nFor the reference, I have been to nakamise dori. Compared to nakamise-dori, I like this place better because it is not as cramped by tourist as nakamise-dori, but the abundance of food is probably same or may be more. Like I think I would have to stay 2 or 3 days to eat all food that I want to eat here. There also various animal cafes.\nThis is the street leading to tsuruka ouga shrine, but I enjoyed the street more than the shrine itself.\nIn summary, this is the must go for those who come to kamakura who love foods like me.",

      "A timeless and powerful symbol of Kamakura.\n\nKotoku in, home to the Great Buddha of Kamakura, is one of Japan’s most iconic and historically significant sites. The bronze Amida Buddha stands over 13 metres tall and has watched over Kamakura since the 13th century. Originally housed inside a temple hall, the structure was destroyed by storms and a tsunami in the late 15th century, leaving the statue standing serenely in the open air ever since. This history adds to the quiet strength and presence of the site.\n\nThe approach to the statue is calm and well maintained, with a balanced flow of visitors that still allows moments of reflection. The setting, framed by trees and hills, creates a peaceful atmosphere that contrasts beautifully with the scale of the Buddha itself. On clear days, the natural light and open sky enhance the sense of stillness and gravity.\n\nVisitors can also enter the statue for a small additional fee, offering a unique perspective on its construction and scale from within. Kotoku in is not just a photo stop but a place that conveys resilience, spirituality, and history in a very tangible way.\n\nA must visit destination in Kamakura that feels both humbling and memorable, and one of the most enduring symbols of Japan’s cultural heritage.",
      "Kotoku in is one of those places that just hits you the moment you walk in. The Great Buddha is massive and incredibly calming to look at, and the whole area around it has this peaceful vibe that makes you want to slow down and sit for a bit. I loved how easy it was to just find a quiet corner, breathe, and take in the atmosphere. Another big plus is that the Daibutsu hiking trail starts only a few minutes from the temple, which worked out perfectly for me since I was looking to hike right after. The whole visit felt grounding and serene. Absolutely a must see when you’re in Kamakura.",
      "Kotoku-in is absolutely worth the visit, even if you’re not usually the type to chase tourist landmarks. The Great Buddha is breathtaking in person—far larger, calmer, and more quietly powerful than any photo can prepare you for. The moment you step through the gate and see the Daibutsu framed by the trees, you feel a sort of stillness settle in, like the whole place is exhaling. That said, it gets very crowded, especially on weekends and around midday; tour groups come in waves, and you’ll often have to wait for photos or shuffle through narrow walkways. If you want space to breathe, go early in the morning or closer to closing time. The grounds are smaller than you might expect, but well kept, clean, and easy to navigate. You can pay a small extra fee to go inside the statue—it’s a quick walkthrough and not essential, but interesting if you like history or structure. Despite the crowds, people tend to be respectful and quiet, adding to the atmosphere. There are drink machines and a few souvenir spots outside the temple entrance, but the real charm is the serene neighborhood surrounding it, with traditional houses, mountains, and a peaceful walk from Hase Station. Overall, it’s one of those places that earns its reputation: busy, yes, but unforgettable, and the calm presence of the Great Buddha makes the visit feel meaningful despite the crowds.",
      "A must-visit place when you come to Kamakura. This temple is home for a Daibutsu bronze statue of Amitābha (searched and found that its meaning is “measureless/limitless light”), seats outdoor, and seems calm and inviting.\n\nWith perfect weather, you can just sit on a large rock and marvel at this gigantic buddha. The place is clean and very well-maintained. Different kinds of trees and several plants surround the temple grounds. Even with lots of people, you can still find a spot to capture its greatness.\n\nEasy and fast ticket purchase. Restrooms available on the left side. Have an ice cream after! After exiting, you can find the Cremia stand outside — across the street, just beside the temple.",
      "Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura) is a nice place to visit and very iconic Buddha statue in Japan. Seeing the Giant Buddha in real life feels quite special, photos don’t really show how big it is.\n\nThe area is easy to walk around and not too complicated. There are souvenir shops inside and outside the temple area, selling Buddha statues in many size options, so you can choose based on your luggage space (important 😅).\n\nIf you visit in autumn, you can also see yellow leaves around the area, which makes the atmosphere more calm and beautiful. Not a very long visit, but very memorable.\n\nGood place to stop by if you are exploring Kamakura and want to see one of Japan’s famous landmarks."

      "I came in through the side access from\n巨福呂坂切通し (Kobukurozaka Pass), and after the previous two temples THIS was the busiest, because it's also closest to the city center. And, there was a procession going on. Where I came through, it turns out that was the gift shop and you pay for prayers to grab a lucky fortune. It's not where you pay to enter. That's further inside the top building, where they have vending machines for a ¥200 ticket, where you have to show it to a person inside. Nice displays of artifacts. Wonderful garden off to the side of the Temple grounds. And where you finally go down to the main entrance into the city, there's a series of street hockers selling things. Nice, sweet smell! 😋\nI just didn't like the crowds of people trying to get their pictures and Instagram photos.",
      "A truly beautiful and peaceful shrine in Kamakura, and definitely a must-visit.\n\nThe long approach leading to the shrine is stunning, especially with the surrounding greenery and seasonal scenery. Walking through the grounds feels calming and well-balanced, even though the area is quite spacious. The shrine itself is majestic and well maintained, with a strong sense of history and culture.\n\nWe enjoyed taking our time exploring the complex, from the main hall to the smaller shrines around the area. It’s a great place for photography, quiet reflection, or simply soaking in the traditional Japanese atmosphere.\n\nAnother plus point — from here, it’s only about a 10–12 minutes walk to Houkokuji 報国寺, making it easy to continue your temple-hopping itinerary.\n\nDespite its popularity, it never felt overly crowded during our visit, and the overall experience was serene and memorable. Highly recommended if you’re visiting Kamakura.",
      "It’s a nice shrine just like others. I like that it’s on the hill so you can see the view of dankazura. The temple itself is not really big but it’s surrounded with trees. The atmosphere is nice. But it was so crowded, so it doesn’t feel calm or peaceful. However, the temple is not far from the JR station. You can walk through the street food which makes this trip more enjoyable.",
      "Tsurugaoka Hachimangu is one of those shrines that feels grand the moment you enter, with its long approach framed by ponds, bridges, and tall trees that guide you toward the main hall. Even if you’ve seen countless photos, the scale and atmosphere hit differently in person—wide stone steps rising up to the bright red shrine buildings, the sound of drums or prayers drifting through the air, and the flow of people moving at an unhurried pace. It’s usually crowded, especially on weekends and holidays, with tourists, school groups, and locals all weaving through the paths, but the size of the grounds keeps it from feeling claustrophobic. There’s a lot to explore: smaller sub-shrines tucked into quiet corners, koi-filled ponds, seasonal flowers, and long, shaded walkways that are perfect for strolling. The shrine is active, so you’ll often see ceremonies, weddings, or blessings happening, which adds to the cultural depth of the visit. The climb up the main staircase can be a bit tiring, but the view of Kamakura from the top—roofs, hills, and the long avenue stretching to the sea—is worth it. Around New Year and festival days, be prepared for serious crowds and lines, but on regular days it’s easy to find peaceful spots if you wander off the main path. There are plenty of cafés and shops nearby, and the whole area feels lively without being overwhelming. Overall, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu is a beautiful, vibrant, and culturally rich shrine that captures the spirit of Kamakura, and even with the crowds, it’s a must-visit.",
      "Tsurugaoka Hachimangu in Kamakura is a stunning temple filled with elegance and history. We were lucky to witness a traditional wedding-related ceremony, adding a rare, magical touch that made the visit even more special and memorable."

      "Hasedera Temple is a very beautiful and peaceful temple in Kamakura. The atmosphere here feels calm and relaxing, a nice break from busy places.\n\nThe temple is located on a higher place, so you can see beautiful sea scenery from above. The view is really nice and refreshing, especially on a clear day.\n\nInside the temple area, you will also find a beautiful garden/park with many Buddhist statues. Walking around this area feels very peaceful and spiritual, and it’s nice to take your time here, not rushing.\n\nThey also have unique souvenirs, much better compared to many other temples. Not just typical items. I bought a nice bracelet here, simple but meaningful.\n\nIf you visit Kamakura, Hasedera Temple is a place worth stopping by. Calm, scenic, and very memorable.",
      "Beautiful place with an observation deck overlooking the coastline. It is important to be quiet and be respectful of your surroundings as it is a shrine where locals come to pray. You have to buy a ticket to enter that, as of now, is priced at ¥400. There are ticket machines with English translations at the entrance and you get a paper ticket that can be kept as a souvenir. There are also information pamphlets in English for visitors to get to know the shrine. Best visited in the morning when there isn’t as many people so you can stroll in a calming atmosphere.",
      "This was a trip in early December when we wanted to see autumn leaves during a day trip from Tokyo. Hasedera Temple was a really enjoyable visit with different things to see - a Buddhist temple cave with wall carved statues and many small relics figures. You can walk through the low and small tunnel of caves for a unique experience.\n\nThere was also a viewing area of the Kamakura coast and town and spacious garden to walk around with areas to pray.\n\nFrom the train station you can take a 45 minute walk towards the coast to enjoy a seaside walk then towards Hasedera temple.",
      "Largest and widespread beautiful temple complex in Kamakura. The many little buildings all carry different deities and are each worth a visit. The central 11 headed Buddha is a must see (no photographs!) as is drifted several years in the see before arriving here. The gardens with all the Jizzos are so nicely arranged and ponds with Kois of different sizes are everywhere. The views from the top of the hill over the town are also gorgeous. Don't miss the Benzaiten grotto with all here helpers where you can donate a statue for well wishes. Mind your head, the grotto has a low ceiling.",
      "If you are in the area, stop by. It's a lovely temple and grounds. We made a day trip from tokyo to see the temple and the big Buddha and preferred the temple way more than the statue. The grounds are beautiful. There's enough space that you dont feel like you are tripping over others. Take cash."

      "The best meal i had so far! Must visit. There are different types of wagyu served and they explain really well despite not so fluent in english. All the wagyu meats are superb, i even like the salad too.\n\nChefs and staffs are friendly, thoughtful and so attentive. Even to the smallest detail such as left-handed chopstick placement for left handed people. They will explain how to eat and what to eat with each type of meat.\n\nOverall, really enjoy dining at this restaurant. Thank you so much.",
      "From A to Z simply incredible! The quality of the food is outstanding. Fresh, perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented. You can see and feel how much love and care goes into every detail.\n\nThe teamwork appears very harmonious, professional and well-coordinated. The service is attentive, warm and always there at exactly the right moment without ever being intrusive. This is exactly what top-level hospitality should feel like.\n\nThe ambience is stylish, cosy and a place where you feel comfortable from the very first moment. I truly have only positive things to say. An absolute hidden gem and definitely a place I will recommend anytime.",
      "Came here after a subpar omikaze sushi experience in Tokyo. We got sat at the bar with our own cook looking after us, table service was quick and punctual and we were not rushed between portions. Friendly to tourists with recommendations provided of which topping to pair with each beef cut. We went with the A5 chateaubriand course and if you’re entering the restaurant for a wagyu experience it doesn’t disappoint. Delightful to try all the various meat and dishes they prepared and I am very glad to have gotten the chance to experience such high grade meat. Learning potatoes aged in snow become delicious and sweet was a nice bonus! I would highly recommend.",
      "The best yakiniku restaurant I’ve ever had. This place completely changed how I understand and enjoy wagyu — each cut is served with the right sauces and salts to bring out its full flavor. The chef and staff were incredibly warm, attentive, and made the whole dining experience truly special. Outstanding food and exceptional service. Highly recommended."

      "The great reviews brought me here while searching for something sweet nearby. I see why there's a long wait but it's unfortunate that they don't have any space inside to sit or at least have multiple cashiers so that the line is much shorter.\n\nI waited 20-30 minutes before it was my time to order. It was worth waiting. Ordered the creme brulee sandwich and it was very delicious!!! Not overly sweet. I would get it again!!",
      "The Internet has not lied... This place is Soo amazing! We tried 6 different types and all of them are amazing in different ways! The lightest but still amazing is the standard whipped cream. In total we tried the whipped cream, creme brulee, hot cheesy Curry, regular Curry, ganache, Short rib. My two favorites are the whipped cream and the hot curry! The spice is just perfect! The staff was so friendly and helpful, English is flawless as well just in case your lacking Japanese.",
      "We got to the location at opening and waited in line for an hour. I honestly was  skeptical about the reviews on this place.  HOWEVER, THE HYPE IS JUSTIFIED.  These sandwiches are delicious!!! I personally loved the creme brulee one!  My mom really loved the apple cinnamon one.  If you buy 3, you get a free to-go box.  The person managing the line was also very kind.  I'll definitely be back and will gladly wait in line again.\n\nJust a heads up, the line starts on the sidewalk by the park, NOT in front of the store.  I recommend getting there before opening.",
      "First taste-expectations were high, but honestly? Kinda mid. Just fried bread with random fillings, no real wow factor. The queue was long (of course), but it moved smoothly. Credit where it’s due: super well-organised. Staff come down the line with menus so you know exactly what you’re ordering before you even reach the counter. Efficient, yes. Life-changing? Nah. Oh you get 1 regular whipped cream sandwich for free if you review them.",
      "I came to see if these sandwiches are as delicious as they look online. I came around 30min after opening and there was a long line already. The process was super organized. A staff member took care of the line and passed out menus so we knew exactly what to order. A crowd like this one could have been tough yo manage staff made the whole wait so much easier.\n\nI ordered the creme brulee and regular cream sandwich. Both were so delicious but the creme brulee was my favorite and I see why it has first place in the menu.\nBoth sandwiches are made with a super buttery, toast. If you've ever had brick toast, this bread is just like the center pieces with a nice crisp outside but soft center.\n\nI absolutely recommend this place. Don't let the line discourage you!"

      "A small but excellent ramen spot in the Ginza district. The process is a bit unique, with two lines. One for payment and another for entering the restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Truffle Ramen, which was incredibly flavorful and rich. The restaurant itself is quite small, seating around 18 guests, but well worth the wait. Highly recommended!",
      "Arrived at 10:40am on a Sunday, we were second in line. Took order at 10:50am, and we were seated by 10:55am.\n\nGot the Special Chicken Paitan Truffle Ramen for 3400 yen.\n\nThe soup was heavy and oily. It had a nice chicken flavour, but the truffle was a little too light. The ramen was cooked nicely and very filling. I was also given the raw chicken and cured meats, which I placed in the soup to cook. The raw chicken didn’t fully cook, but ate it anyway as I don’t think it was expected to by fully cooked with the soup not being scorching hot.\n\nOverall, I was expecting more given the hefty price (3400 yen). Everything was minumum 3000 yen. Would not recommend going especially if the line is long. Truffle flavour could have been stronger.",
      "I was looking for ramen options without containing pork, and found Ginza Kagari’s Chicken Soba, which uses a chicken-based broth with no pork or lard in the toppings. Visited during winter and the queue was fairly long, but very well organized, so waiting didn’t feel too tiring even while standing.\n\nThe highlight is the broth gently rich with a refined chicken flavor. Light but still layered, and especially comforting in cold weather. The noodles are thin with a nice bite, and the chicken topping is tender and juicy, clearly cooked with care.\n\nOverall, it’s a well-balanced, subtle, and elegant bowl of ramen. A solid option for anyone who wants to enjoy ramen while avoiding pork. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
      "The broth of the chicken ramen was so creamy it almost creamed me. The ramen here is definitely more of a fusion style rather than traditional, with ingredients such as bell peppers, pumpkin, truffle mushroom etc. I think the varying flavours and textures from the unorthodox ingredients definitely helped bring out the broth even more. The chicken itself was very tender and firm. Overall highly recommend.\n\nLike a lot of other Japanese restaurants, this store is extremely narrow with very limited seatings around the counter. But the staffs are very professional and efficient so things move very smoothly. Still, expect to wait if you want to do walk-in",
      "Infamous soba in Ginza that is paired with grilled chicken. It tastes just okay, not outstanding to my taste, as the broth is quite thick and oily.\n\nThere are only around 12 seats, and someone has taken the order whilst we’re waiting outside. It is pretty quick if you arrive early, and please note all the parties must present before they could let us in."

      "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5-Star Review\n\nMenbaka Fire Ramen offers a truly one-of-a-kind dining experience that goes far beyond ordinary ramen shops. The most unique highlight is their dramatic fire ramen presentation — exciting, memorable, and unlike anything you’ll find elsewhere. It’s not just a meal, it’s an experience.\n\nThe service is impressively fast and well-organized, even during busy hours. The staff are attentive, professional, and clearly experienced in delivering this special style of dining while making guests feel comfortable and safe.\n\nMost importantly, the ramen itself is absolutely delicious. The rich, flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and well-balanced toppings come together beautifully. Every bite feels thoughtfully prepared and satisfying.\n\nIf you’re looking for a ramen place that combines great taste, efficient service, and a unique, unforgettable dining experience, Menbaka Fire Ramen is a must-visit. Highly recommended! 🔥🍜",
      "Holy Cow I love this place!!! Never in my 44 years of life have I had a culinary experience like this. You must try it. We didn’t have reservations but got there shortly after the opened and I think we just got lucky as it filled up quickly and every other party had reservations. Multiple language options to lay out the rules to ensure everyone’s safety. Everyone person has to order something unless they are under 6 years old and they don’t seem to like substitutions given the discussions I heard from party next to me. Best to just go with the food the way it is. They know best. Only a short walk from Nijō Castle. If you are going to be in the area make reservations and go!!! You will have a blast.",
      "I was staying at the hotel right across the street and each night, I would see a long queue of diners there, waiting for their turn patiently. The evening before departing Kyoto, I decided to check it out for myself so I walked over and joined the queue. I had a fun time there. Dinner comes with a show. The food was very good and the team was very friendly and efficient. Everyone knows their part and things run like clockwork. Once you are seated and placed your order, they will walk you through the experience but nothing truly prepares you for what comes next. I was a bit excited to try it out and I am glad I did! One for the experience!",
      "The ramen was pretty good and the staff really put on a show. If you wait outside you can see their capsule machine with some pin merch. Overall the staff was pretty enjoyable to interact with. They have a rig for phone mounting capture the fire ramen safely.\n\nI got the chicken, gyoza, and ramen set. Overall, I take it that the price is to cover the popularity the place has and the show you get. Otherwise, it is quite on the pricier side of things if you dont value these things. Anyways the food was all okay. Pretty good but a bit on the salty side.",
      "Food was very delicious! Didn't know about the show before hand but the food was so good and so worth it! Would def go back. We also got a bottle of delicious saki that was to die for. I would recommend making a reservation, we were a party of 4 and the only reason we got a seat was because we did an early dinner (around 5.15pm). Another group our size tried to come after us and couldn't because all the seats were reserved."

      "After seeing the instagram reels decided to come check it out. Had the Kyo no shio ramen and Yamato no pirikara miso ramen with a side of gyoza which was served with 3 sauces. All the sauces and gyoza were nothing special. I wouldn't be able to tell them apart from frozen ready gyoza and the sauces were just bottled sauces. The shio ramen was also meh just tasted like any other ramen but with a weaker broth, the char on the pork was a really nice smoky element of the dish though. The miso ramen was significantly better and was one of the only things we ate in japan with a decent spice level. For the price and quality you are getting if you want just a regular bowl of ramen I would suggest going somewhere else. If you want something spicy Yamato no pirikara miso ramen is an option",
      "⏰ We first tried going in the evening, but the line was out the door with a 2 hour wait since the shop is small. We came back the next day for lunch before 1pm and got seated right away.\n\n🍲 Yamato Pirikara Ramen – Creamy and rich, but surprisingly light. It didn’t leave me feeling heavy or overly full. The bowl is packed with noodles, so if you’re adding gyoza or a light eater, I recommend the half-portion noodles.\n\n🥟 Gyoza (side) – A great complement to the ramen, flavorful and not greasy.\n\n🥩 Chashu Pork – Possibly the best pork I’ve ever had: soft, flavorful, and not too heavy. I would come again, just for a side of the chashu.\n\n🌱 Bean Sprouts – Loved that they were partially submerged, letting them absorb the broth’s flavor while keeping a slight crunch.\n\nOverall, an excellent ramen spot — absolutely worth planning your visit around the crowds because nothing is worth a 2 hour wait.",
      "Quite overhyped on social media for what it is.  Only foreigners eating here (evidently from the waiting list and queue outside). We waited about 40min. Service was pretty quick once seated, the ladies took our orders and helped with water refills promptly. Gyoza was solid, good flavor and crisp texture. Ramen looked good, but was quite the let down in terms of flavor. I got the spicy miso, which was not really spicy, and the broth was honestly way too bland. The Egg was overcooked as well. I did like the Chasiu, that was quite yummy, but really not the best ramen in town and definitely not worth the wait. Cash only",
      "Over 15 years of my visit this is the best ramen I have ever have and I tried a lot. Have visited this place many times since 2010. Still the best. Recommend ramen #18. Great music too.\n\nI prefer ramen here to the famous men-ya inoichi. Highly recommend.",
      "Waited a little over an hour during a busy time. The staff were so kind and out of 5 different bowls of ramen I enjoyed on my 2 week visit to Japan, this was the best one, and all the bowls I had were great! I believe I had No. 28 on the menu.\n\nI would like to thank this restaurant for an outstanding meal and experience. This was recommended to me by a friend that traveled to Japan in the past, and so shall I pass the word on to anybody traveling here in the future. Do yourself a favor and eat here."

      "Engine Ramen was absolutely worth the wait. The line was very long, but it ended up being one of the best — if not the best — ramen experiences I had in Japan as a vegan. They also offer gluten-free options, which is a huge plus, and the gluten-free ramen was just as amazing as the regular one. We tried the Kyoto vegan beaning ramen with gluten-free noodles, the vegan zesty ramen with regular noodles, and the gluten-free dumplings, and everything was excellent. Portions were generous, flavors were outstanding, and despite the long wait, I would 100% do it again.",
      "Visited here as a table for 2 on New Year’s Eve. We queued for around 10 minutes and were able to drink a beer whilst queuing.\n\nThis place is pretty good, albeit not our favourite ramen spot on our trip. The gyoza were meant to come in a soup but we asked for them to be without the soup at the thought of the being runny. They were quite overcooked and we’ve definitely had better.\n\nThe ramen was good, again not the best but still very strong with great flavours, a really deep and spicy broth but nothing to shout home about.\n\nGiving this four stars as it was nice but nothing special. Service was okay but if you’ve been to other ramen spots you’ll have experienced better.",
      "Came here due to the well-regarded reviews and was not disappointed. Entering was wonderful, being greeted by the friendly and welcoming staff who sat us down upstairs. I had a wonderful vegan ramen with soup dumplings. The ramen was great however the soup dumplings led to the dumplings getting slight soggy and losing their texture. I do see why the reviews speak so highly of this place, wonderful food and a welcoming atmosphere, really enjoyable place.",
      "Wowwowowoweeeee this is some GOOD ramen!!! Broth was soo very flavorful and noodles were perfectly fresh! It was so nice that they had such accommodating options like vegetarian and pork-free chicken ramen! 🫶🫶 Really appreciated their quick service too! I will be thinking about that bowl of ramen for a longgg time.",
      "Highly recommend going at opening time because the lines get long! As a couple with a vegetarian wife and non vegetarian husband we love places that have both options!\n\nThe ramen is tasty, flavourful and extremely filling! The staff is friendly and makes sure to ask about allergies and preferences.\n\nWe had the Vegan Zesty Ramen & Zesty Miso Ramen (Pork). We also had peach wine which was the best we had in Japan."

      "First visit to Shogun Burger, and it was a great experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, and although the shop itself is small with pretty tight spacing, the food and atmosphere definitely made up for it.\n\nThe burgers were huge with generous portions. I also appreciated that they provided ketchup, mustard, and three types of their own branded hot sauces right on the table—something many burger places don’t do since they try to upsell their products. Their hot sauces were surprisingly good and felt like high-quality stuff.\n\nHighly recommend stopping by to see what they have, and definitely give it a try if you’re passing by. We really enjoyed our meal here.",
      "We pulled up multiple locations. This one was the smaller one in Shinjuku . But it opened late .\n\nThe burger I had was the double wagyu with onion . I loved it! Period.\n\nShe had the single cheesburger with ham and said the same .\n\nWe also other an assortment of fries , chicken and onion rings as a side. It was good however I didn’t like the skin of the fried chicken.\n\nThe smoky whiskey highball was interesting! But good .",
      "After hitting nearly 50,000 steps in Shinjuku, we were definitely craving something filling, and Shogun Burger delivered. The fact that it's open late made it an easy win.\n\nWe ordered the teriyaki burger combo, a double cheeseburger with no mayo, and chicken nuggets. The burgers were excellent. Soft buns, juicy wagyu patties, and cooked perfectly. Adding mustard really elevated the wagyu flavor and took the burgers to another level.\n\nThe chicken nuggets were just okay and a bit greasy, but honestly, you come here for the burgers and they do not disappoint. Ordering was quick and easy, the food was delicious, and it was the perfect stop before heading off to our next destination.\n\nOverall, a great late-night spot and a solid choice if you're in the mood for a quality burger in Shinjuku.",
      "Presentation, amazing, food is very good taste quality, side sauces are pretty good, ranging from basics to some Japanese style side dipping sauces.\nThe fries were perfect, not too long or short, good crisp and crunch, good volume as well.\nEvery burger they serve comes stamped, in the photos below we had the bacon and egg wagyu beef burger and the teriyaki burger. Both meals, one vanilla and one Nutella shake.\nAnd those shakes are very good. Smooth and slightly thick consistency, but not too thick to where you’re getting personal with your straw.\n\nAfter the fact we ordered fried onion rings and those were just as good as you’d imagine.\nEveryone was very nice, spoke English and Japanese, you order on entry on an electronic device which made it super quick.\nFood came quicker than most spots in Shinjuku.\n\nI’d give it a good try, but be aware that some of the burgers are actually massive.. jaw breaking..",
      "A BURGER SO PREMIUM IT FEELS LIKE A LUXURY CAR\n\n·\n\nTHE BURGER LOWDOWN\nthis isn't just a burger. this is a shogun burger, meaning they use legendary wagyu beef for their patties. that's the whole flex right there.\n\nTHE TASTE TEST\nthe result is delicious, even for the price. the quality is immediately obvious. their signature hot sauces are also delicious, with options like hai-sai, yakiniku bbq, and extra hot to level up your meal.\n\nTHE VIBE\nthe space is clean with good seating, and the staff is very nice. they're kind enough to explain how to order on the ticket machine, which is a major help. plus, the cool branding extends to some seriously stylish merch.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\nfor a next-level burger experience where the ingredient quality is the main character, this is a major yes. it's a splurge that actually feels worth it. a must-try for burger enthusiasts.\n\n·\n\npeep the images for your ref; they’re worth a thou.\n\nmake sure to ❤️!"

      "Amazing stationery destination in Ginza!\n\nGinza Itoya is one of the best stationery stores I’ve ever visited — a must-stop in Ginza for anyone who loves pens, paper, planners, and unique gifts. The store is beautifully designed and spread across multiple floors, each with a different theme. From elegant fountain pens and high-quality notebooks to cute stickers and practical office supplies, there’s something for every taste and purpose.\n\nThe selection here is huge, and you can find both luxury and affordable items. I especially enjoyed browsing the premium pens and the beautifully crafted Japanese paper. There are also original Itoya items that you won’t find anywhere else, which makes great souvenirs or thoughtful gifts.\n\nThe staff were helpful and polite, offering recommendations without being pushy. The atmosphere is calm and inspiring — perfect if you want to take your time exploring. There’s even a café area where you can sit and plan your purchases!\n\nIt’s easy to see why both locals and tourists love this place; I noticed many people taking photos and leisurely shopping, especially on weekends. Whether you’re into journaling, drawing, or office supplies, Ginza Itoya is a stationery lover’s paradise!",
      "Excellent stationery shop with a wide variety across many levels. I was delighted to buy really special Christmas cards as well as unique and beautiful stationery items. Could have spent many more hours browsing! Some areas get a little congested with shoppers but still easy to select items. The cafe on the top floor was lovely too.",
      "Excellent stationary shop with probably the most variety I've seen. The prices are average though(at least for the fountain pens and inks), but that's fine because the service and testing of pens is really valuable. Everything is presented well too. Although, the queues for staff assistance on fountain pens is quite long(20-45 min), which is troublesome especially if you're a tourist tight on time.",
      "Ginza Itoya is a stationery lover’s dream.\n\nMassive, beautifully organized floors packed with everything from premium pens and notebooks to a serious art section (brushes, paints, sketchbooks) and an incredible selection of seasonal greeting cards—especially the Christmas cards and displays. The store feels clean, calm, and thoughtfully laid out, so even with how big it is, it’s easy and fun to browse.\n\nStaff were polite and the overall shopping experience felt very “Ginza”—high quality, tasteful, and inspiring. Easy place to lose track of time in the best way.",
      "I was really happy to see that they have a good range of fountain pens, including some special ones from Sailor. I picked up a few inks too. My favorite part was the craft section because I loved seeing all the stamps and punchers. The only thing to watch out for is the area with the regular gel pens. It gets extremely crowded after 12 noon, so it is better to go earlier. There is barely any space to move around once it gets busy."

The location is very convenient, near Ginza Station, and the building also includes a café and hotel, making it a great place to visit even if you’re not planning to shop.",
      "This MUJI flagship store has a huge selection and much to explore.\n\nThey have a bakery on the first floor, skincare to sample (including solid perfume), dishware, stationary, storage, snacks, clothing etc. We enjoyed browsing the racks of reMUJI items like jeans and multi-paneled/patterned shirts. This store even carries fire extinguishers, pet accessories, and live plants.\n\nThe tax free counter closes early, and staff help you prep for smooth flow as the line can get long. If you're not needing tax free, there are self check out kiosks on every level (w/ staff available to assist).\n\nI was looking for pants they used to carry that had an extra back pocket perfect for putting my phone. Hope they consider restocking in the future. Staff tried to help look.",
      "a lot of items to pick! yet so cheap.. a pen costs 150yen and it’s multi functional. the surrounding is very nice and the music they play is calming. Hm their product quality is very good! I love their skincare and clothing. staff is very nice and very friendly. not to mention i like how they dress. That’s all.\n\nKindly reviewed by me:)",
      "I tried the bakery inside, had the chicken curry bun. Loved the crust on the outside. The curry inside was delicious. The store had a food level on the ground floor. There were frozen food and ready to eat food available. There was also cafe dining as well.",
      "They have great selection of quality items ranging from notebooks, pens to mugs and small bags\n\nI visited the cafe to rest from a long walk around Tokyo and Ginza. Coffee was reasonably priced and bought mixed nuts on the side. Very good atmosphere, I would comeback if I am in Ginza area again"

      "Very cool store. Lots of things and stuff in stock. I bought a very nice collector's edition watch. The employees were nice but when adjusting the fitment, they kept the adjustment tool that came with my watch. While the tools are not expensive, it is the special one that comes with the watch and when you buy something new and that is special, you expect them to include all the original contents. It was probably an accident, and I don't think they stole it. It is just unfortunate. Also, they will only sell you the display models which is a bit disappointing to have no choice but to buy something that has been handled an unknown number of times. They say they only have the display models in stock. We went back the next day to buy a second watch and learned this was a lie. So I gave them 2 stars. Nice store and lots in stock. But the employees at best were slightly lazy and at worst politely dishonest.",
      "Spread across 5 floors and may occupy a few hours of your day if you decide to really look through every home product that they sell.

Tax free check out line could take around 10-20 minutes though.",
      "I felt like an Ikea but Japanese. The top floor is a different store so be careful. Don't bring the wrong product to the cashier. Also they didn't let me take pictures of some of the stuff but I took it anyways. Here are the pics they stop me from taking. I don't know why",
      "Very cool store. I enjoyed this one more than the Shibuya one. But, Shibuya had way more paper/journal/notebook options than here.\n\nRandom toys, cameras, vintage papers and crafts, cards, home goods. Really enjoyed spending time here. A bit crowded on a Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Loft had a lot of products. I was honestly confused which floor to stay in because there were too many items to view😂 The lines were fast too because each floor had its own counter. The building is also wheelchair friendly, it has an elevator."

Great place for lunch, dinner or drinks in the evening.\nThere's a 15% discount for lunch on weekdays, and a happy hour for drinks in the evening.\n\nThe sushi is high quality and the side dishes are also great.\nI recommand the Nams roles and the seafood misu soup.",

      "A tip to other people visiting:\n\nBuy your tickets at the start of the day or better yet the day before ONLINE IF POSSIBLE - I don't care what google says in terms of traffic flow, whatever people say in terms of 'walking in' it is simply not true\n\nBuy them online especially if weather predictions state that there could be any chance of rain - everyone has the same idea of visiting this place as a rainy day event\n\nOtherwise you will have to buy your ticket to reserve your time slot to enter when you get there - they won't even let you in five minutes early. Then you have to pretend you're interested in buying stuff at the marketplace next door to the aquarium to kill both your feet and your time for the next three hours.\n\nBut aside from the hassle of buying your entry ticket, the aquarium itself is wonderful. Its streamlined, super tidy, well ventilated with lots of information littered around the aquarium. All the staff speak english and very willing to answer all your questions.\n\nThe way the aquarium is designed, you start at the top of the building and make your way down in a cyclical fashion - the aquarium revolves around one gigantic tank. However, I spent a good two and a half hours without realising it - I don't know how they managed to get two baby whale sharks in there.\n\nThere is a wide range of animals to see, I particularly liked the jellyfish section and I'm happy I got to see my favourite fish - the garden eel.\n\nThere are plenty of toilets and one cafe. I recommend eating before arriving to the aquarium in general, the prices of food in the marketplacs next door is expensive imo even by tourist standards\n\nThe aquarium is accesible friendly, wide, with guide lights and gently sloped floors with elevator access if needed. Though it can difficult for those who struggle with seeing in the dark at times.\n\nTL:DR - Yes I would recommend this aquarium, I implore to book tickets advance and online - save yourself the grief of turning up on the day and then having to wait three hours. Eat beforehand and make sure to have a good time :)\n\nTo avoid crowds, go on a weekday where its super sunny, otherwise prepare for congestion on rainy days and on weekends",
      "we had a really nice visit at the osaka aquarium. we were soooo excited to see the beautiful whale sharks!! they had so many different kinds of fish and sharks and the penguins were adorable. there are a lot of educational signs and information in the aquarium. the aquarium is tourist friendly. all exhibits are clean, natural looking, and not overly crowded. unfortunately the antarctic exhibit was closed but we still got to see different penguins. we are very particular in only visiting ethical zoos and aquariums, so i was pleased to learn this aquarium maintains their exhibits well, and contributes to education, research, and marine conservation awareness, and runs scientific programs. the aquarium is. short walk from the train station and is next to stores and restaurants. no need to purchase tickets in advance, you can buy them there and the wait is not long.",
      "The aquarium was great. The displays are modern and there's decent viewing areas throughout.\nThe Antarctic display was partially closed during our visit.\nA little more variety or interactiveness would've made it better. We went on a Tuesday and so the crowds weren't overwhelming.",
      "The Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan is impressive and very well done. The layout is easy to follow, and the tanks are huge, allowing you to see marine life from different angles as you move through the building.\n\nIt’s very easy to get there by public transportation, which makes the visit convenient. I visited on a weekday on Christmas Day, and even then it was very crowded, so I highly recommend buying tickets in advance through their official website.\n\nThe highlight for me was definitely the whale shark—seeing it up close in such a massive tank was unforgettable. Next to the aquarium, there’s also a shopping and dining complex with restaurants and stores, which is nice to explore before or after your visit.\n\nDespite the crowds, it’s still worth visiting, especially if it’s your first time. Just plan ahead and be prepared for a lot of people.",
      "This aquarium lives up to its fame. We paid ¥2700 for the base ticket + additional ¥1500 for the backstage viewing. Once you enter the building my, you take a very long escalator to the top 8F and we started our journey by going into the back stage area at the top floor. No photography was allowed in the backstage area which was a shame and you need to take off all accessories and store them in the provided lockers. We were then ushered into the backstage where you can see down into the 9 meters deep tank. The duration for this is 20 minutes and there were brief introduction in Japanese and English on the 2 whale sharks. After the backstage viewing, we started descending the building where there are exhibits from many regions. The path down is wrapped around the main tank with many viewing areas so you can see the whale sharks from multiple angles. All up, I think they have done a really good job of re-creating the habitats of the animals/fishes and it was a very enjoyable day."

      "Went to TL Botanical around 7pm on a warm November evening.\n\nI will start this review by saying that this is my first TeamLabs experience, so I'm very much treating it on its own merits.\n\nYou're essentially doing a night time walking tour of a park with illuminated sculpture installations and music/sound. So set expectations accordingly. It takes around an hour to hour and a half to get all the way round the handful of exhibits, and is generally a pleasant experience with some nicely thought out installations.\n\nCrowds were minimal, so I'd say the winter on a weekday is a good time to go. Zero queuing and ample space to see and photograph the installations.\n\nAt time of writing, it's priced fairly reasonably for what it is, just over £10. Compared to the cost of attractions in the UK I feel like this represents fairly decent value, though possibly feels slightly expensive in the context of Japan overall as most attractions are very cheap really.\n\nMy only real criticism is that it's very, very easy to trip over things as your night vision is almost non existent from continuous viewing of lit up objects, and the illumination around the paths is kept to the absolute bare minimum - so watch your step.\n\nIf you're keen on night time photography you'll be able to get some great shots, I feel like this absolutely adds some value if you're into taking photos.\n\nGo in with an open mind and reasonable expectations, and you should have a nice hour or two.",
      "Quite nice for a relaxing evening experience, especially not when many other people are inside. Lights changing colors and ambient music all around, great for memorable photos. Got tickets the day before, you get to enter any time it's open (18 to 20:30), there was almost no people at the ticket holder line so didn't have to wait. Free app provides a map and description of the light-up instalations.\n\nThere's around 8 slightly themed areas, most of these react to people passing through or interacting, so the experience is somewhat unique to everyone. I walked very slowly and took a bunch of photos everywhere, and it took me just over 1.5 hours; if you just walk through it might take 15-20 minutes or less. Overall, liked the concept a lot, but going in blind I expected there to be more different stuff, the journey through felt rather short.",
      "This place is MAGICAL. Fair warning, this is a night activity at a nature park. So there's gonna be a lot of walking on uneven terrain, natural paths and slopes. But it's worth the extra 5000 steps in your step counter. The lights and art installations in nature at night brings you back to your childhood imagination of a fairytale world. You can't help but run and frolick, interacting around the installations. There's a lot of people visiting the place, but due to the wide open spaces, you don't feel that your space is encroached. I do recommend you come in spiring or summer. I went as winter hits, and its COLD. A must visit.",
      "Nice 6 areas but underwhelming versus the other two I saw in Tokyo. The one in Odaiba is by far the best. The only one si found very interesting is the section with the wind turbines throwing air in the plastic tubes.. that's impressive.\n\nAt the same time a nice excuse for a long walk around the park at night away from the crazy Osaka rhythm and people.\n\nA few illuminiscent arrows on the grounds would help clients inside the installation navigate better.\n\nSuggest you arrive later than 6pm as it was super busy as opening but at 7pm super fluid.",
      "this place is really not bad at night. there was various different spots of light such that you wouldn't feel bored, it ranges from colourful trees to some kind of eggs to a small light show in the forest. I feel like the Tokyo one is maybe better tho.. but this is still something decent. the place was relatively big, I would recommend to go to this place with a group of friends. I would say that this place is very good for dates and pictures! it is a 10 minute walk away from the station too, so it's convenient. there was also relaxing music playing which fits the ambience."

Great array of gaming consoles available. You can play for as long as you like as long as you're buying drinks, which is fair enough. We had great fun playing some 80's arcade games, would definitely go again.",

It is easy to lose track of time here.\nThe owners are very friendly, and you can tell they genuinely care about the bar and the people who visit. That personal touch really stood out to me (probably the Canadian in me, lol).\n\nThere are stairs to get inside, so keep that in mind. Overall, I had a fantastic time and would highly recommend this spot for a solo visit or a night out with friends.",

      "Very lively place with many interconnecting shopping areas, mostly sheltered. It is very easy to explore and has many eateries around. Love the place and am really glad our hotel is just nearby. Gets really crowded on weekends but you can always walk through another parallel lane to get to where you want. Most of the restaurants only open from 11am but a few fast food do open early.",
      "Dotonbori is one of the most iconic and energetic districts in Osaka, and it perfectly captures the city’s lively spirit. From the moment you arrive, you’re surrounded by bright neon lights, huge animated signboards, and a constant buzz of activity that makes the area feel alive at all hours.\nShopping options are everywhere. The streets are lined with popular fashion stores, souvenir shops, cosmetics outlets, and small specialty stores, making it easy to shop casually or seriously hunt for unique finds. You can stroll without a plan and still end up with bags in your hands.\n\nFood is the real star of Dotonbori. There are countless restaurants, casual eateries, and street food stalls serving Osaka classics like takoyaki, okonomiyaki, ramen, sushi, and grilled seafood. The variety is impressive, and many places stay open late, perfect for night cravings.\nBe prepared for crowds. Dotonbori is almost always busy, especially in the evenings, with locals and tourists filling the streets. While it can be overwhelming, the lively crowd adds to the excitement. Dotonbori is chaotic, colorful, and unforgettable. It’s a place where people watching, spontaneous photos, and late night snacks come together to create memories you’ll probably talk about long after your trip.",
      "Dotonbori is lively, colourful and packed with energy — neon lights, giant signboards screaming for attention, and endless (though often repetitive) food options. It’s definitely an iconic spot to check in and experience at least once. I went mainly for the snow crab restaurant; otherwise, it’s a place I might skip simply because of the heavy crowds.\nAt peak hours, it gets extremely congested, making it hard to explore shops, take photos, or even walk comfortably. Buying things or queuing for food takes patience due to the sheer number of people.\nStill, the bustling atmosphere is part of the charm. If you enjoy vibrant streets and don’t mind moving at a slow shuffle, it’s an exciting way to soak in Osaka’s city vibe. Best visited during off-peak hours for a more pleasant stroll.",
      "A must see when in Osaka obviously! We came during the day. Most of the canal businesses weren’t open, I assume it’s big in the evening. The surrounding shops and eateries were great! The street vendor food was great. The Japanesey of it all was great.  Thoroughly enjoyed wandering around here and well worth spending time here",
      "Personally feel like social media made the place feel overhyped. The area felt a lot smaller than I thought. All the crowds are centered along Ebisu Bridge and the shopping streets around it. Glico sign is just how you imagine it, nothing to special.\n\nRecommended to visit both day and night if you have time. Vibe of the place is entirely different. The neon lights at night are really neat.\n\nIn the end, I still feel like an hour around the area would suffice. If you're not into touristy activities like boat riding or heavy shopping, there's not much to do except for soaking in the vibe."

      "Minoh park was such a lovely place even in the middle of winter. It was quiet with just the river, birds, and occasional footsteps of locals. The hike is easy, but if you want to take a more natural route, once you reach the first split, there is a cafe to the right along with a small village across the bridge, that path is gorgeous but ensure you wear appropriate footwear.\n\nUnfortunately some of the stores at the waterfall have burnt down, but hopefully they get rebuild or cleared out soon.",
      "A tranquil walk up to the waterfall. There's a trail and a flat road path to the waterfall. For the trail, aim for the 地獄胡 sign. There are stairs to climb and the views are amazing. There's a small stall that sells ice cream and red bean soup at the waterfall that taste great as well. Toilets are everywhere, no worries.",
      "This park was a beautiful calming walk- we visited Katsuoji temple, took a taxi to the fountain and walked from there to the station. It wasn’t a difficult walk at all with options for slope or steps. The autumn foliage was beautiful and the park allowed for amazing scenery with great lighting through the foliage. There are toilets dotted throughout the route with several cafes, stalls and restaurants also spread out along the route. Very peaceful day",
      "Overrated.  Don’t get me wrong, the forest is beautiful especially during autumn season, but there’s far too many people both at the falls and along the trail for this to be a truly relaxing activity in my opinion. The falls itself is not impressive relative to other hikes I’ve done.\n\nThere are many other hikes that I’d rather do than this one. It’s suited for a family walk since the trail is easy.  Otherwise you’ll find better views, the autumn colors, and a more peaceful experience on other hikes that has less people along the path.",
      "Beautiful trip from Osaka. After a week in a big city, it's nice to relax in nature for a while. The advantage is that you can get there from the city in no time. I recommend exploring the area around the station as well."

      "Visiting Expo ’70 Commemorative Park is a unique experience that blends history, art, nature, and relaxation beautifully. The park itself is expansive and green, with wide lawns, gardens, and trees — a perfect escape from the city bustle and a great spot to unwind or enjoy a stroll.\n\nThe Tower of the Sun is the crown jewel of the park. Standing about 70 meters tall, with its bold arms and three symbolic “faces” representing past, present, and future, it’s a striking piece of public art — powerful, memorable, and instantly recognizable.\n\nInside, the tower reveals more than just its dramatic exterior. The restored interior exhibits include the “Tree of Life,” a massive installation illustrating the evolution of life, from primitive organisms to humans — a rare chance to see such a bold artistic and conceptual statement in a public space.\n\nAccess is easy via public transit, and park hours are well defined (typically 9:30–17:00; entry until 30 minutes before closing).  Admission is quite reasonable — the park itself is inexpensive (or free, depending on area), with a small fee to enter the Tower of the Sun or additional exhibits.",
      "A stunning huge park great for relaxing and spending time with family and friends. The Tower of the Sun is super cute on the day and the light show in the evening give it extra dimension. There is also a large Japanese Garden inside which is simply beautiful - well designed and mesmerising even in autumn and winter. There is also a museum and other areas in the park that are worth visiting. We happened to be when there was Ramen Expo, which we had so many delicious ramen across the country. Overall, a super nice park that I will be happy to visit again and again.",
      "Expo ’70 Commemorative Park is one of Osaka’s most spacious and rewarding urban green spaces, blending history, nature, and culture in a beautifully maintained setting.\n\nBuilt on the grounds of the 1970 World Expo, the park still carries the spirit of innovation and optimism from that era, most famously represented by Taro Okamoto’s iconic Tower of the Sun rising boldly from the landscape. Wide walking paths, peaceful lawns, and seasonal flower gardens make it an ideal escape from the city’s bustle, whether you’re strolling through cherry blossoms in spring, sunflowers in summer, or autumn foliage in fall.\n\nThe Japanese Garden is especially striking, offering a calm, traditional atmosphere with ponds, bridges, and manicured plants that feel worlds away from nearby urban life.",
      "This park is a hidden gem! It's beautifully maintained and full of lush greenery, with a wide variety of trees and plants that make it feel like a natural escape right in the city. Whether you're walking, jogging, or just relaxing, the fresh air and shade from the trees make it an ideal spot. There are plenty of quiet corners to sit and unwind, and the landscaping is clearly well cared for. A perfect place for nature lovers or anyone looking for a peaceful break outdoors.",
      "Visited during last summer September 2025.\nThe park is large. Went there mainly to visit the expo 70 museum and the signature tower. Maybe we visit during weekend and without any booking, tickets all sold out!  It's a long queue to the tower of sun souvenir shop (which is a little shop).\n\nIt's a good experience to visit the expo 70 museum. It's an amazing experience to visit the ethic museum!! A large collection from all over the world and I wish I have enough time for it. Definitely worth to spend a half day inside the museum."

      "If you’re visiting the Namba or Dotonburi area, you absolutely have to make a pit stop at Namba Yasaka Jinja. It’s tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, but once you walk through the gates, you can’t miss it.\n\n​The star of the show is definitely the Shishiden (Lion Head stage). I’d seen photos online, but honestly, they don't do it justice as it was so much bigger than I expected! Standing in front of those massive teeth and wide eyes is a bit surreal. It’s supposed to swallow evil spirits and bring you good luck, and it definitely feels powerful (and makes for an incredible photo).\n\n​I visited first thing in the morning, and it was the perfect call. There weren't many people around, so I could really take in the atmosphere without the crowds.\n\n​They have a really cool variety of omikuji (fortune slips). I ended up getting one that comes inside a beautiful carp-shaped case. It’s super high quality and makes for a great little souvenir to bring home and display on a shelf.\n\n​One of the sweetest things I saw was their selection of amulets. They have these adorable tiny schoolbag charms (randoseru). They’re designed to protect little ones on their daily journey to and from school. It’s such a thoughtful gift if you have kids or younger siblings back home.\n\n​It’s only about an 8-minute walk from Namba Station, making it an easy detour before you head off for some Dotonbori street food.",
      "Namba Yasaka Shrine is a unique and memorable shrine in Osaka, best known for its massive lion head stage, which is both striking and symbolic. Despite being located near busy Namba, the shrine grounds are small, mostly flat, and easy to walk, making it very accessible. It’s usually not too crowded, so you can take photos comfortably, especially of the lion head from the front. A quick but worthwhile stop for visitors interested in something different from traditional shrine architecture. I spent around 5 minutes just to take photos here. And there is no entrance fee.",
      "This is a shrine for worship and it is famous for its main structure, a giant lion with its mouth wide opened. It was impressive seeing it in person. We were there around 9am and the sun was gleaming through. It was busy even early in the morning.\nThey have all kinds of amulet, even Hello Kitty ones.",
      "Namba Yasaka Jinja (難波八阪神社) is one of Osaka’s most visually striking and atmospheric shrines, famous for its enormous lion-head stage that seems to watch over the grounds with a fierce, protective gaze. Tucked away in the energetic Namba district, this small but powerful shrine offers a surprisingly calm and spiritual break from the nearby crowds, noise, and shopping streets.\n\nThe massive lion structure is said to swallow evil spirits and bring good fortune, especially in business, examinations, and personal success, making it a meaningful stop for both locals and visitors. Despite its unique design, the rest of the shrine remains traditional and peaceful, with prayer areas, stone lanterns, and shaded spots that invite quiet reflection.\n\nFor photographers, Namba Yasaka Jinja is a must-visit. The angle, scale, and dramatic expression of the lion’s open mouth create a dynamic subject that changes beautifully with different light throughout the day. It’s equally captivating in bright sunlight and soft evening glow.\n\nEasily accessible and never overly commercial, Namba Yasaka Jinja is a hidden gem in Osaka that blends tradition, symbolism, and unforgettable visual impact in a compact, tranquil setting.",
      "A unique and memorable shrine in Osaka. Namba Yasaka Shrine, located in Naniwa Ward, is famous for its striking design and long history, especially known for warding off bad luck and bringing good fortune.\n\nThe highlight is the massive lion head hall at the entrance. It’s incredibly impressive in person and is believed to “swallow misfortune and bring victory.” Definitely a must visit if you’re hoping for a bit of extra luck.\n\nRemember to prepare a 5 yen coin for the offering box, as the pronunciation of 5 yen (go-en) symbolizes good connections and blessings.\n\nAfter praying, you can browse a variety of omamori charms. The schoolbag shaped charm is especially cute and popular for students wishing for academic success. You can also write your wishes on an ema plaque with twin lion heads and hang it up at the shrine.\n\nThe shrine is fairly small and easy to visit about 30 minutes is enough for praying, buying charms, and taking photos. A great stop if you’re exploring the Namba area and want something culturally meaningful yet quick to visit."

      "Visiting Shitennō‑ji during a light drizzle was incredibly calming and refreshing. The cool air and gentle rain gave the entire temple a peaceful, almost meditative mood. The stone paths, wooden halls, and garden areas looked beautiful with the soft sheen of rain, making the whole place feel quiet and chill.\nEven with the drizzle, walking around the grounds was soothing — the sound of raindrops, the cool breeze, and the tranquil atmosphere made it easy to slow down and enjoy the moment. It’s one of those places where you can just breathe, wander, and feel a sense of calm settle in.\nShitennō‑ji is already a serene temple, but visiting it in cool, drizzly weather made it even more special. A perfect spot for anyone looking for a peaceful break in Osaka.",
      "I visited Shitenno-ji yesterday, and honestly, I was surprised I had never been here before.\n\nI studied Japanese more than 20 years ago, lived in Kyoto, and have visited Osaka many times over the years—but this was my first time at Shitenno-ji. If I had known how special this place is, I would have come much earlier.\n\nThe main hall is absolutely beautiful, featuring Buddhist life stories depicted in an art style that feels subtly Indian-inspired, very different from what you usually see in Japan. The hall at the back, illustrating the journey of Xuanzang (the monk behind Journey to the West), is equally impressive, with delicate and expressive murals.\n\nA hidden gem is the Dragon Reflection Well—many visitors only notice the coins at the bottom, but if you look carefully, you’ll see a dragon image reflected in the water, created by the dragon carving on the roof above. A quiet, poetic detail.\n\nWhat moved me most is the temple’s deeper meaning. Shitenno-ji is known as a “temple of the setting sun.” In ancient times, the elevated ground here allowed people to watch the sun set into the sea. It was a place for reflection—reminding visitors that life, too, moves toward its own sunset, and that awareness brings clarity, humility, and peace.\n\nA truly underrated temple in Osaka—rich in history, art, and quiet wisdom. Highly recommended.",
      "Visiting Shitennō-ji 四天王寺 was a very good experience. As one of the oldest temples in Japan, it has a strong spiritual atmosphere, and it is known as a place related to Kōbō Daishi. Walking through the temple grounds feels peaceful, and you can really sense the history and religious importance of the site.\n\nOne of the nice things about Shitennō-ji is that the surrounding area is quite calm and not crowded with tourists. This makes it easier to enjoy the space, take your time, and appreciate the architecture and the quiet environment. The layout of the temple buildings, pagoda, and gardens creates a pleasant space to walk around and reflect.\n\nOverall, it’s a lovely place for worship and a gentle escape from the busy parts of Osaka. The calm surroundings and spiritual atmosphere make Shitennō-ji a meaningful and relaxing visit. 🌿✨",
      "Shitennō-ji greets visitors with a calm, expansive presence—neither cloistered like Kyoto’s temples nor grand in the way of Nara’s ancient shrines. Instead, it embodies a uniquely Kansai kind of serenity, a quiet confidence shaped by centuries of history. Passing through the weathered wooden gate and stepping onto the stone pathway, you feel as if each step draws you deeper into a living timeline.\n\nThe temple’s layout is dignified and symmetrical. From the lecture hall to the central gate, and finally to the five-story pagoda, the red-and-white structures stand out beautifully beneath the wide blue sky. The pagoda in particular shines with subtle touches of gold, its lines graceful and composed—solemn, yet approachable. It does not overwhelm with grandeur; rather, it invites you to slow down and appreciate its quiet harmony.\n\nThe pond at the front adds a soft rhythm to the space. Walking along the water’s edge, you see the reflections of the pagoda and drifting clouds ripple gently across the surface, as if time itself is breathing in slow motion. The warm tones of the autumn leaves along the stone railing echo the temple’s deep red beams, creating a tranquil and cohesive scene.\n\nWhat makes Shitennō-ji truly captivating is its balance between the sacred and the urban. Despite being surrounded by modern buildings and steady foot traffic, once you step onto the main axis of the temple grounds, a peaceful clarity settles in. This is not a place where you must sit still to find calm; simply walking, pausing, and observing naturally brings your mind into a quieter rhythm.\n\nWhether you’re drawn to historical architecture, searching for a pocket of tranquility within the city, or simply wishing to stroll through a space where past and present coexist gracefully, Shitennō-ji is one of Osaka’s most worthwhile destinations. It is a temple that has endured for over a millennium, yet continues to offer the same gentle, unadorned beauty to everyone who visits.",
      "I had not done any prior research and arrived at the temple in the late afternoon, when it was already closed. What a pity! I was unable to access the main hall, but the exterior is already remarkably beautiful - striking architecture, small ponds, and lovely trees. Everything was very clean and well maintained. The outer grounds are free to visit, while entrance to the interior requires a paid ticket. The site is large, with several access points, and I ended up getting lost and entering through an adjacent cemetery. Upon arrival, I noticed a few local vendors packing up their stalls into their vehicles, suggesting there may be a small local market nearby. I imagine it is connected to the temple and to the historical heritage of Tokyo and Japan. If I return to Osaka, I will definitely plan to visit the interior area as well!"

      "Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane—the revered deity of learning—offers a rare moment of serenity within the fast-paced rhythm of the city. The moment you pass through its stone torii gate, the noise of the streets begins to fade, replaced by the stillness and gentle gravity unique to ancient shrines. Under the soft, overcast sky captured in your photos, the entrance feels even more solemn, inviting visitors to slow their steps.\n\nInside the grounds, the space opens wide yet remains intimate. Buildings under restoration stand beside beautifully preserved wooden structures, creating a striking contrast between old and new—a reminder of how this shrine has quietly watched over Osaka for centuries. Footsteps on the sandy courtyard sound crisp in the cool air, adding to the meditative atmosphere that naturally draws you inward.\n\nThe small sub-shrines, wooden gates, and traditional rooftops carry the charm of craftsmanship shaped by time. The purification pavilion and prayer hall feel welcoming, attracting visitors who come to seek blessings, express gratitude, or simply reconnect with themselves amid travel.\n\nThe omamori you hold—a black charm adorned with gold, pink, and white plum blossoms—beautifully reflects the elegance of Tenmangu. It is more than a souvenir; it is a small piece of the shrine’s protection and warmth, carried back into everyday life.\n\nOverall, Osaka Tenmangu is a place where the heart naturally settles. Even with modern buildings rising just beyond its borders, the shrine maintains its own timeless rhythm. Whether you visit to pray for success, enjoy a quiet walk, take photos, or find a moment of peace during your journey, Osaka Tenmangu offers a gentle, enduring sense of calm that lingers long after you leave.",
      "Beautiful place to visit and reflect!\nDedicated to Sugawara no Michizane the god of learning and art, Osaka Tenmangu is a historic shrine that offers a serene atmosphere and hosting one of Japan's most spectacular festivals . It's a wonderful place to experience both the spiritual and local everyday life of Osaka",
      "When I was there, it seems to have a night event with busy staff working on setting up a few structures.\n\nStill, as an important religious center for the locals, it also has the venue for wedding ceremony and other important events. A significant shrine with magnificent history.",
      "The shrine was gorgeous. A bit of repairing did slightly ruin its image, but not to worry. In summer months it gets very hot and very bright so maybe consider bringing a cap or some sunglasses. I’d also cover your shoulders if possible, knees didn’t seem so much of a problem. The smaller shrine near it is the centrepiece in my opinion though. Great for pictures under the line of Torii gates and also a quiet place to respite from the city life.",
      "For now, you may want to skip this visit as they are undergoing some renovations. I hope to pop by when they completed the renovation. Locals still come by and do their prayers as per normal."

      "We visited Osaka Castle Park in early January 2026, and it was absolutely beautiful. The park is very spacious with plenty of garden clusters, making it perfect for a relaxed walk while enjoying nature in the middle of the city.\n\nThere are many food stalls scattered around the park, which adds to the lively atmosphere. The view of Osaka Castle is stunning, especially with the castle surrounded by ditches and canals that make it feel even more majestic and historic.\n\nWhat we loved most were the hidden gems inside the park, including a figurine museum and various spots that explain the history of Japan and Osaka in an engaging way.\n\nA must-visit place if you are in Osaka. Highly recommended and thumbs up!",
      "Walking around the castle grounds with my wife and kids was very enjoyable. The park is spacious, clean, and family-friendly, perfect for slow walks, photos, and letting kids move freely without feeling cramped. The scenery alone already feels worth the visit, even without going inside the castle.\n\nThat said, a small constructive note: the walk from the nearest station to the main castle can feel quite long, especially with kids or strollers. Also, the interior museum experience inside the castle is more educational than immersive—some interactive elements could make it more engaging for children.\n\nOverall, a must-visit historical spot in Osaka with beautiful seasonal views. Come for the scenery and atmosphere, take it slow, and enjoy it as part of a relaxed family day.",
      "Osaka Castle is one of the most iconic spots in Japan, and it truly lives up to the hype. The castle sits beautifully in the middle of a large park, surrounded by moats, stone walls, and peaceful walking paths that make the whole place feel grand but relaxing at the same time. The castle itself is stunning up close, with its white walls, green roofs, and golden details that look amazing in photos.\n\nIf you can, visit both during the day and at night. During the day, you get the full scenery and lively atmosphere, but at night the castle lights up beautifully and feels much quieter, almost magical. It’s a completely different vibe and perfect for photos or a peaceful evening walk.\n\nOverall, Osaka Castle is a must-visit—rich in history, beautiful to explore, and even more special if you experience it both day and night.",
      "Walking through Osaka Castle Park 大阪城公園 in autumn was an amazing experience. The park is filled with many trees turning beautiful shades of red, yellow, and orange, creating a colorful scenery all around the castle area. It feels very refreshing to stroll along the wide paths while enjoying the seasonal colors.\n\nThe contrast between the autumn leaves and the impressive castle tower makes the view especially memorable. There are many nice spots to stop, take photos, and simply enjoy the moment. Even though it’s a popular place, the park is large enough that you can still find quiet areas to relax and take in the atmosphere.\n\nOverall, Osaka Castle Park during autumn is a wonderful place to experience nature in the city, enjoy the changing leaves, and have a peaceful walk surrounded by beautiful colors. 🍁🌿✨",
      "The area around Osaka Tower is filled with beautiful gardens and flowering trees. There’s also a pond-like section surrounding the tower, which creates a very scenic atmosphere. It’s a lovely place to visit for both local and international visitors.\n\nWhen I visited during autumn, the trees were especially gorgeous with their seasonal colours. Inside Osaka Tower, you can also enter with a ticket to explore exhibits about the ruler connected to the tower’s history. You can then climb up to the observation deck at the top floor for a stunning view of the surroundings.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend visiting this place. It’s a peaceful, beautiful spot that offers both nature and history in one location."

      "Incredible site to see, especially for a non Japanese tourist, just a wonderous place to visit, full of history, we also took the Aqualiner cruise ride that takes you around the castle.\n\nOne of Japan's most famous landmarks and a significant symbol of the unification of Japan during the sixteenth century. Today, the castle's main tower serves as a modern museum set within a vast municipal park.\n\nMuseum & Observation: The interior of the main tower houses a museum dedicated to the history of the castle and the life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, while the top floor offers panoramic views of the city.\n\nImposing Architecture: The site is renowned for its massive stone walls, impressive moats, and the iconic white, green, and gold aesthetic of the central keep.\n\nCastle Park: The surrounding park covers about two square kilometers and features the Nishinomaru Garden, which contains approximately 600 cherry trees, making it a premier spot for cherry blossom viewing.\n\nToyotomi Era (1583): Construction began under the orders of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who intended it to be the center of a newly unified Japan. It was the largest and most formidable castle of its time.\n\nDestruction and Rebirth: After Hideyoshi's death, the castle was destroyed by Tokugawa forces during the Siege of Osaka in 1615. The Tokugawa shogunate rebuilt it in the 1620s, only for the main tower to be struck by lightning and burn down in 1665.\n\nModern Reconstruction: For centuries, the castle remained without a main keep until the current concrete structure was built in 1931. Miraculously, it survived the air raids of World War II, though many other parts of the grounds were damaged.\n\nMajor Renovation (1997): A comprehensive restoration project was completed in 1997, which modernized the interior and restored the exterior to its former Edo-period glory.",
      "This place is amazing for any traveler looking for things out of the ordinary. The exhibit is really well done and the outside of the castle is free. Beautiful scenery and a rich history. You can also dress up as a samurai and take a photo. I would recommend.",
      "Osaka Castle really surprised me in the best way. I’m not even someone who’s usually into historical sites or museums, but this place pulled me in fast. The castle itself is ridiculously pretty up close with that mix of traditional architecture and bold colors that makes it look almost like a painting. The huge park around it adds to the whole vibe really peaceful, lots of open space, and since I went in January the cold kept the crowds light, which honestly made the whole experience even better. It felt calm instead of chaotic.\n\nWalking around the castle grounds and then exploring the inside gave two totally different perspectives. The museum was way more interesting than I expected, with clear stories about the wars, rulers, and how the castle came to be. It was easy to follow even for someone who isn’t a history person. Overall, it’s an absolute must-visit in Osaka. You get beauty, calm, and a deep sense of the city’s past all in one stop.",
      "Osaka Castle is a very big and impressive place that many visitors enjoy. The castle itself is large, beautiful, and looks very grand. With its white walls, green roof, and golden decorations, the castle stands out clearly and feels strong and powerful. It is one of the most famous landmarks in Osaka.\n\nThe area around Osaka Castle is also very wide. There are large parks, open spaces, trees, and walking paths, so visitors can walk for a long time and still feel comfortable. In spring, many people come to see cherry blossoms, and in other seasons, the view is still calm and pleasant. The size of the area makes the castle feel even more special and important.\n\nInside the castle, there is a museum where visitors can learn about the history of Osaka and the castle itself. From the top floor, you can enjoy a nice view of the city, which shows how big Osaka is.\n\nOverall, Osaka Castle is a beautiful and powerful place. It is big, well-known, and very impressive. Visiting Osaka Castle gives you a strong feeling of history, beauty, and greatness all in one place.",
      "Beautiful place, totally free to visit. A lot of historical value where we can learn many things but also see the grand and majestic castle of osaka. A little bit of trekking and incline walking here, fits perfect with autumn / winter weather. You can also see the beautiful sky from there."

      "I visited this place a few days ago during my stay in Kyoto, and it was absolutely beautiful even in winter. Every corner was full of charming details that made me stop and admire it. They also have a museum inside but photos aren’t allowed, which honestly makes the experience feel more special but you can pick up some lovely souvenirs at the end to bring the memories home with you 🤗.\n\nI would happily come back here again, especially for the incredible matcha in Uji. It’s the kind of place that stays in your mind and makes you want to return.",
      "The Harmony of Byodo-in\n​1. Architectural Elegance\n​The Phoenix Hall is designed to resemble a celestial palace from the Pure Land (Buddhist paradise). Its symmetrical structure consists of a central hall flanked by two wing corridors and a tail corridor, mimicking the shape of a bird spreading its wings. The vermilion-colored pillars and the sweeping curves of the tiled roofs create a sense of lightness, as if the entire building is about to take flight.\n​2. The Mirror Effect\n​One of the most striking features in your photos is the \"Amida Pond.\" The temple was intentionally built on an island in the middle of this pond to create a perfect reflection. On a calm day, the water acts as a mirror, doubling the temple's beauty and blurring the line between the physical world and its spiritual reflection.\n​3. Spiritual Symbolism\n​Perched on the roof are two golden Phoenixes (Hōō), which represent grace, virtue, and rebirth. This temple is so significant to Japanese culture and beauty that it is featured on the back of the 10-yen coin and the 10,000-yen note.\n​4. Seasonal Serenity\n​The composition of your photos—framed by pine branches and set against a dramatic, moody sky—highlights the Wabi-sabi aesthetic. There is a profound sense of peace and \"impermanent beauty\" in the way the ancient wood and bright paint stand against the natural landscape.",
      "Visiting Byōdō-in Temple 平等院 was a very beautiful and memorable experience. The moment you see the Phoenix Hall reflecting on the surface of the pond, it feels like a classic scene from a Japanese painting. The elegant architecture and the calm water together create a peaceful atmosphere that is easy to enjoy.\n\nWalking around the temple grounds feels very relaxing, with well-kept gardens and gentle pathways that invite you to slow down and appreciate the surroundings. The combination of nature and history makes the visit enjoyable, and every angle offers a different, picturesque view.\n\nThe museum inside is also interesting, and it helps you understand more about the temple’s history and its cultural importance. The detailed artwork and the Phoenix ornaments are especially impressive and show the fine craftsmanship of the period.\n\nOverall, Byōdō-in Temple is a wonderful place to visit if you appreciate quiet, beautiful scenery and traditional Japanese architecture. It leaves a calm and lasting impression. 🌿✨",
      "Byodoin Temple is truly breathtaking and is my favorite temple in Japan.\nI visited during the autumn night illumination season, and the atmosphere was incredibly calm and peaceful. The temple manages visitor flow very well — entry requires advance reservations and visitors are admitted in time slots. This arrangement works wonderfully. Unlike other temples that feel overcrowded, Byodoin allows you to experience its beauty in a much more serene and relaxed way.\n\nThe reflection on the water was so beautiful that it felt like another world. We spent about 90 minutes slowly walking through the entire route.\n\nIt was truly a worthwhile and unforgettable experience!",
      "A stunning and one of the famous Buddhist temple in Uji, Kyoto. famous for its iconic Phoenix Hall featuring golden phoenixes and housing Amida Buddha, symbolizing the Buddhist Pure Land, with its architecture and beautiful garden designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can find also on the 10-yen japanese coin. A breathtaking view of temple in the middle of pond"

      "Peaceful hilltop temple. In early October, unfortunately we missed hydrangea garden which was completely closed, and lotus season had passed though you could see the plants in front of the main temple. There is a lovely view over lots of greenery which was just starting to turn yellow, would be lovely in a few weeks when leaves are red.\n\n¥1000 entry fee charged at the bottom of the hill. Note that there are approximately 40 large steps to reach the top. Located in a quiet area of Uji, it is about a 30 minute walk through residential areas from JR Uji station.",
      "I visited in early June 2023 — a great time to see Japan’s hydrangeas in full bloom. Tickets are available at the entrance and they’re pretty affordable. The garden is spacious, filled with blooming flowers, and the ones along the stairs were especially lovely. I had such a nice time here.",
      "Mimuroto-ji and hydrangea garden - a beautiful temple and garden full of hydrangea. We were there at around 9:30 am and the garden was already filled with people. There is an entrance fee for adult 1000 ¥ and children 500 ¥. There is a 5 to 10 minutes walk from the gate to the garden. You can probably easily spend an hour or two to enjoy the hydrangea garden. Once you are done with the garden, there is another 10 to 15 minutes walk up hill steps to the Mimuroto temple.",
      "Although the entry fee is quite expensive (1,000¥), it's worth it. This beautiful temple is surrounded by a garden of hydrangeas blooming in many colors. The majority of visitors are local people, so not many tourists visit this place. Highly recommended to visit during June in Hydrangea season.",
      "One of the main component of tourist attraction in Uji, Kyoto. I visit during the hot sunny day, yet many visitors still come to enjoy the beauty of this temple. You can pray here by buying the 100Yen incense. More, you can try to touch the egg in the rabbit stomach or cow's mouth. You can enjoy and have a bit walk around this place to observe the beauty."

      "Riding the Amanohashidate Chairlift and Monorail 天橋立ビューランド リフト・モノレール山麓駅 was a fantastic and very enjoyable experience. The ride itself feels relaxing, and slowly going up the hillside gives you a beautiful chance to take in the scenery. Looking out over the mountains, the ocean, and the famous sandbar all at the same time is really impressive.\n\nWe visited during the red-leaves season, and the colors made the view even more amazing. The bright autumn foliage, the blue water, and the gentle coastline all come together to create a picture-perfect scene. It feels like watching nature from above, almost like floating through a landscape painting.\n\nThe chairlift has a fun open-air feeling, while the monorail is comfortable and easy, so both options are great depending on what you prefer. Overall, the ride up to View Land was a wonderful and memorable part of the visit, with some of the most beautiful views in the area. 🌿🍁🌊✨",
      "Wow! The chair lift ride was a breathtaking experience, offering stunning views of Amanohashidate's picturesque sandbar and the Sea of Japan. The serene atmosphere and majestic scenery made it a memorable experience. Once you reach the top, there's even more to explore - try the sky bike, merry-go-round, or simply unwind at the cafe while taking in the views.",
      "The chairlift itself is very very good! The views are magnificent! I didn’t have any wait at all. The staff is very friendly. At first it was a bit scary, but if you sit properly you’ll definitely be okay. In winter the staff even put some sack on the seats, presumably to make the seats not too cold I guess.",
      "Great place with great views! We made it to the chair lift at 4:30pm on the dot. Fee is 1,000 yen per person if I remember correctly.",
      "What an awesome place, clearly one of the best views in Japan. Get out of Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto and explore a bit, Japan has these gems. We cycled through the park before going to the view land. It was like meditation, all our stress gone."

      "Stunning views and light‑hearted fun! We took the chairlift up to the top and were rewarded with breathtaking panoramas of the Amanohashidate sandbar — especially the famous ‘matanozoki’ view where it looks like a dragon soaring into the sky when you look at it upside down.\n\nThe scenic lookout itself is worth the trip, and there are a few small rides and attractions like a Ferris wheel, merry‑go‑round, and pedal cars that are perfect if you’re visiting with kids.\n\nIt’s a great stop for photos and relaxing with the view of one of Japan’s ‘Three Scenic Views.’ If you’re short on time, even a quick visit for the views alone is rewarding. A fun and memorable part of our Kyoto trip!\"",
      "It is a very beautiful place with stunning scenery. The view from the top of the mountain is breathtaking. The cable car ride from the base station to the summit is fun and feels very safe. At the top, there is a small theme park with a train and a Ferris wheel, which adds to the overall experience. A must come if you are around!",
      "Visiting Amanohashidate Viewland 天橋立ビューランド was a very good and enjoyable experience. The viewpoint offers a wonderful panorama of the famous sandbar, surrounded by mountains and the ocean on both sides. The scenery is beautiful and gives a clear idea of why Amanohashidate is known as one of Japan’s famous views.\n\nWalking around the area at the top is pleasant, with different spots where you can stop, take photos, and enjoy the landscape from various angles. The atmosphere is relaxed, and it’s easy to spend time here just looking out over the bay and the long stretch of pine trees below.\n\nIt’s a great place to appreciate nature and take in the impressive scenery, especially on a clear day. Overall, Amanohashidate Viewland is a lovely spot to enjoy beautiful views and a memorable moment in the area. 🌿🌊✨",
      "Amanohashidate View Land Park is absolutely worth the visit. The views are stunning, especially from the famous “upside-down” viewpoint, offering a breathtaking perspective of one of Japan’s most iconic landscapes.\n\nThe park itself is well-maintained and family-friendly, with simple rides and open spaces that make it enjoyable without feeling overly commercialised. The atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant, making it a great place to spend time rather than just a quick photo stop.\n\nHighly recommend trying the pudding and ice cream at the park - both are excellent and surprisingly good quality. Simple, fresh, and perfect after walking around while enjoying the view.\n\nA well-rounded experience combining scenery, leisure, and good treats. Definitely a must-visit in Amanohashidate.",
      "What a fab idea to combine an amusement park with a grand scenic lookout - great for families with kids and even for couples and adult groups alike!\n\nReally fun rides that give a higher vantage viewpoint - cycle ride and the Ferris wheel. But there are also other rides, like go-kart, carousel, shooting gallery, archery. Tickets are ¥400 per person per ride, regardless of the ride type, and can be purchased at the ticket self-service machine at the souvenir shop next to the Ferris wheel ride.\n\nThere is also a restaurant here the serves ice cream and hot food (rice and hot noodles soup). Ample toilets are around and they also provided a tent with a heater placed inside to take shelter from the rain (we visited early Dec, and when we came, it was raining, so the tents were very useful, temp was 8 degrees Celsius)."

      "Strolling along Philosopher’s Path in autumn feels like walking through a quiet painting.\n\nThe canal reflects red and gold leaves, and the gentle path lined with temples and old houses brings a calm that settles in instantly. A simple, peaceful walk, yet one that lingers long after.",
      "Serene walk in December, away from the hurly-burly of life and away from the hustle and bustle of Kyoto.\n\nThe path was pretty deserted and the trees almost leafless but the air was crisp and the sky clear leading to an unforgettable afternoon stroll in a very historic city",
      "To avoid the crowds, I did the walk south onto the Philosopher’s Path. From Hōnen-in, you walk downhill toward Nanzen-ji direction. You’ll follow the canal — this is the Philosopher’s Path proper. Go off path, explore, take your time. Travelling in Autumn was a bonus as was late afternoon light.",
      "Well that's odd: Google decided to place this review for a place in Kyoto when in fact it was entered for a place in Heidelberg, Germany. Someone apparently noticed it and that helped me to notice it. Let's see if I can sort this thing out as Google's clearly not up to the task.... I should I should add, of course that Kyoto is a simply awesome place to visit and now that I know that there's also a philosopher's walk there. I'm definitely going to visit there next time I'm in town.\n\nA very nice place to visit with exquisite views of the old town and castle in Heidelberg. Parking is a little bit of a challenge in this area so if you can't secure parking at the local garage then you may have to walk much further. On this note I should mention that the closest garage has been remarked by some to be extraordinarily claustrophobic but I had no problems navigating two in or from it.",

      "This intimate yet thoughtfully designed space packs all the essential elements of a traditional Japanese garden into one compact experience. The main tatami-floored viewing room offers comfortable seating where you can enjoy seasonal sweets while contemplating the view.\n\nStep outside to discover their specialty - an exquisite moss garden featuring remarkable biodiversity. The carefully curated varieties create a lush green tapestry that changes character with the seasons.\n\nPhotography enthusiasts will appreciate that landscape shots are freely permitted (though portrait photography requires an additional fee). For convenience, tickets can be purchased online or with cash on-site.\n\nThis hidden gem beautifully distills the essence of Japanese garden design into an accessible, rewarding visit. The attention to detail in both the architecture and horticulture makes it well worth including in your Kyoto itinerary.",
      "Zen was an understatement when visiting this beautiful garden in early November. The crowd was very very small still. Not sure how it’s like during peak travel seasons.",
      "My husband and I visited this hidden garden in June 2023, and it was truly a wonderful experience. We purchased our tickets on-site, which included tea and a cookie—a lovely touch. The place was peaceful and not crowded at all, making it even more enjoyable. We would definitely love to visit again!",
      "Pretty garden, not as manicured as most Japanese gardens, interesting history. This is why I gave it only 3 stars- when booking, they stressed that they only allow small groups in so you can have a calming experience and enjoy strolling the garden at your own pace. When we entered, there were at least 12 people waiting and there were at least 20 others milling about. I’m glad we didn’t opt for the tea and sweets as we probably wouldn’t have enjoyed it much with people walking around us, talking into their smartphones while narrating videos, and taking selfies. It is not a large building or garden so it seemed congested to me. I guess that’s to be expected now that Kyoto is one of the biggest tourist destinations in all of Japan. Too bad.",

      "The Beauty of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n​A Vertical Cathedral: The towering stalks of bamboo create a sense of infinite verticality. In the second image, looking up toward the sky, the interlocking canopy filters the sunlight, creating a \"Komorebi\" effect—where light dances through the leaves like a natural stained-glass window.\n​A Palette of Natural Tones: There is a beautiful contrast between the cool, silver-green hues of the bamboo culms and the warm, earthy browns of the traditional \"Take-gaki\" (bamboo branch fences). These fences don't just mark a path; they ground the ethereal forest in Japanese craftsmanship and history.\n​The Sound of Silence (and Movement): Even in a still photo, you can almost hear the \"clacking\" of the stalks and the rustling leaves. The third image, showing visitors wandering through the path, highlights the scale of the grove—making the humans look small against the majesty of nature.\n​A Path of Contemplation: The winding dirt paths and the rhythmic patterns of the bamboo create a meditative atmosphere. It is a place where the bustling modern world (represented by the tourists) meets an ancient, towering stillness that feels frozen in time.",
      "Visiting Arashiyama Bamboo Forest was one of those Kyoto moments that really stayed with me. Walking between the towering bamboo felt surreal, almost like stepping into another world where everything slows down. The way the light filters through the tall green stalks and the soft sound of the bamboo swaying in the wind creates a calm, almost meditative atmosphere that’s hard to find anywhere else.\n\nI went early in the morning, which made a huge difference. It was quieter, cooler, and felt more peaceful before the crowds arrived. Taking my time along the path, I found myself just looking up, breathing it all in, and appreciating how simple yet powerful the scenery is. The walk itself isn’t very long, but it doesn’t need to be — the experience is more about the feeling than the distance.\n\nWhat I loved most is how close it is to other beautiful spots. After the bamboo forest, wandering around Arashiyama, crossing Togetsukyo Bridge, and grabbing a coffee nearby made the whole area feel like a perfect day out. Yes, it gets busy later on, but even then, the bamboo forest still feels special. It’s one of those places that reminds you why Kyoto is so unforgettable and why slowing down while traveling really matters.",
      "Arashiyama Bamboo Forest Review (Expert Traveler Insight)\n\nIf you want to know what silence looks like, open the photos first. This is one of those rare places where the pictures tell half the story — and the experience tells the rest. As an experienced traveler and detailed reviewer, I can confidently say Arashiyama Bamboo Forest stands among the most breathtaking natural walks I’ve ever taken.\n\nThis forest isn’t just famous — it deserves the hype. The towering bamboo creates a cathedral-like canopy that feels peaceful, almost spiritual. But here’s the real insider tip: take a rickshaw. Yes, it sounds touristy, but it’s actually the smartest way to explore. Your guide brings you through special inner routes that the general public cannot access, helping you avoid the crowds entirely. They also take incredible photos for you — shots you simply cannot get on your own.\n\nBeyond the forest, the surrounding market area, fall colors, and side streets add even more to the experience. Plan for at least 4–6 hours to enjoy it without rushing, and make sure you dress for the weather as it can feel cooler under the bamboo.\n\nThis was one of the most unforgettable parts of our Japan trip — peaceful, iconic, and absolutely worth every minute. Don’t leave Kyoto without experiencing this.",
      "Quite crowded but a beautiful area. It is worthwhile also visiting the Snow Monkey Park as well to round off the trip. Local river is stunning with greater and lesser Egrets and cormorants. Also had fun hiring a kimono and walking around the temples and villages with the red maple leaves. I would say that if you wanted a quieter tranquil bamboo forest the side hike up to Mt Inari near Tori gates was more serene.",
      "Best is to arrive before 10 am due to crowds.\nIf you want to do the train ride 🚂 you should book in advance and the boat ride 🛶 we couldn’t do due to cold weather🥶\n\nYou can walk towards Otagi temple, it’s quite scenic neighborhood and also less crowded. On the way you’ll have coffee/tea spots 🍵 ☕️ see my other reviews to see which one i recommend!"

      "Well worth a visit! I believe it’s 1000 yen to enter, but it’s much quieter than at the bamboo forest and it’s very pretty.\nYou’re starting to see some autumn colours (mid October), and the garden is just wonderful. The views of Kyoto from the top are also lovely as you can frame the vistas with the surrounding foliage.\nYou walk most of the time through isolated stones that can be a tad slippery if their wet (it rained this morning) so be careful and bring adequate shoes.\nNot suited for wheelchairs or strollers.\nYou’ll also be able to hear and possibly see some beautiful birds ❤️",
      "Well worth to visit this beautiful garden estate, in my opinion even more than the garden of a hundred flowers. Incredible scenery and perfectly cared for plants. The Zen garden part should not be missed. We probably spend 30 minutes there relaxing and taking it in.",
      "Worth to visit here!! I never known this place before , just walked through Arashiyama bamboo and found this stunning place.\nThe garden is very big, entrance fee is just 1000 yen. Inside , there is a relaxing place with tea free of charge.\nThe atmosphere is superb !!",
      "Beautiful gardens with amazing views. I was disappointed though that on my visit the tea house had closed down ( it was removed from the signage too). The price at 1000Y was high when compared with the most famous gardens in Japan. If you are in the bamboo forest, a walk through the free park there is equally rewarding."

      "We were in the area for a family weekend onsen trip and noticed cable cars while driving on the highway. We came back the following day as weather was clear and Mt. Fuji was fully visible.\n\nAt 3,500 yen per adult, ticket price is steep. Having said that, if you plan to spend at least a few hours here and enjoy amazing views, into photography, or spending it with a special someone, it could be worth it. The viewing area above is well-maintained and seems to have received recent upgrades. If you have a stroller, which we had, you won't be able to see/access every area.\n\nIn terms of food and drink, coffee was disappointing but the black curry was pretty good! We also enjoyed the dango, and while youkan was too sweet for our liking, we couldn't resist getting them for the photo opp.",
      "There is a very nice view of Mount Fuji from here. The round-trip ropeway fare on this day was ¥3,500. The black curry they served was very delicious; however, the coffee was disappointing. I ordered a chocolate latte, but it tasted watered down and stale—and I’m not even a coffee snob.\n\nThe garden looks especially nice at night. On this day, there were no clouds, so Mount Fuji was clearly visible. I arrived around 4:30 p.m., and they close at 5:30 p.m. There were very few people at that time, which made it a great way to enjoy the evening quietly.",
      "The view at the top is breathtaking!! The tranquility and beauty of Mt.Fuji gave me the chills because it is purely beautiful to see and admire.\nYou can choose to hike up the mountain. Because we're travelling with two kids under 4yo -- we opt for the cable car. It is clean, roomy, and very well maintained. Not scary at all~\nThere are many facilities at the top. There are cafes, some eateries, souvenir shops, a small shrine area, kids playground, a food onsen and plenty photo spots with Mt Fuji as backdrop.\nMy kids went straight to the kids area first (of coz) - climbing ropes, flying foxes, slides, etc. There isn't any soft paddings on the ground.....most are dirt and rocks....so would suggest supervising the younger kids when they are playing.\nGo make time and get a drink or small snack at the cafe, so that you can enjoy the seating they have near the infinity \"pool\". There are massive day bed sofas available outside too....which i believe you can rent hourly.\nThe food are delicious and reasonably priced!!\nDefinitely worth visiting when in the area :D\nVisited back in Oct 2022.",
      "well landscaped and up lifting refurbishing of a viewing park\nsouvenirs were really expensive\nwe enjoyed the foot bath a lot",
      "Great experience. We went around 3pm and it wasn't crowded at all. We had the cable car to ourselves and get to enjoy the amazing view. The view of Mt Fuji at the top was amazing. There's few restaurants at the top which you can sit and enjoy the view. Comes with a small garden for you to walk along and a free foot spa with an amazing view! Parking was free. The shop sells a lot of cute souvenirs and Japan snacks!"

Very narrow and tree limbs and big rocks in the road. However, I am still glad we made the trip here. I wouldn’t go out of your way to come but if you are nearby it is entertaining to check out. 1200¥ per adult to pay and walk down to the monkeys. There were several people who did not want to pay so they just stood in the parking lot and watched from above. You can pay ¥1000 for a bucket of food and feed the monkeys or ¥300 for a cup. There were a lot of babies this visit.",

I would guess they choose to hang around here because they are fed here.\n\nThey are still wild though so follow the rules.\n\nIt is located in a beautiful bay between 2 tall cliffs. You can see the monkeys climbing the cliffs, especially after they are fed and bored after eating.\n\nThere is only one type of monkey here as it is the native species to Japan, the Japanese macaque, also known as the Japanese snow monkey as many famous pictures of them are in the snow sitting in hot springs.\n\nThere is a building you can go inside and purchase food to feed the monkeys through bars. You are the captive here and the monkeys reach through the bars to get the food from you. They will fight over it so don’t be alarmed.\n\nThere were dozens of monkeys out when we came. They will walk close to you and are not afraid of people, but they are wild. Again, follow the rules. We had no problems with them.\n\nI would come here everyday if I lived nearby.\n\nThe drive is long and difficult to get here but worth it for me.",
      "Expensive but worth it. Could be better maintained for the price. The road to the bay is hazardous. I saw someone driving a BMW with a flat tire but we made it just fine. The monkeys were cute!"

      "I was tossing up whether the 1500¥ on the cable car was worth the trip. It was. If you have good weather and visibility I highly recommend this whole complex. The history, gardens, shrine and lookouts are all excellent. There is even a restaurant at the top, though I did not go there.\nHighly recommend!",

      "Mt. Nesugata Summit Observation Deck (寝姿展望台) offers breathtaking panoramic views of Shimoda Bay, steeped in history and natural beauty. Highlights include an old cannon, historic info boards, and a peaceful walking area. (4/5)\n\nFull Review\nMt. Nesugata Summit Observation Deck – A View with Substance and Style\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nThe summit of Mount Nesugata (寝姿山) is more than just another scenic overlook—it’s a blend of natural splendor, subtle historical reverence, and understated refinement, all perched above the charming port town of Shimoda.\n\nAfter taking the Shimoda Ropeway, which itself is a smooth and scenic ride if timed right, you arrive at the summit and are immediately rewarded with stunning panoramic views of Shimoda Bay. The real centerpiece is the harbor vista, which unfolds beneath you like a living painting—one that, during my visit, was graced by a ship that looked plucked from a different era, sailing among modern vessels. It’s this juxtaposition—past and present sharing the same waters—that quietly underscores the site’s historical weight.\n\nWander a little and you’ll encounter a cannon and its miniature replica, next to an informative plaque recounting an 1849 encounter between an English survey ship and the Tokugawa shogunate’s reconnaissance efforts. It’s not a full-on museum, but the touches of history are thoughtfully placed and help contextualize the location beyond its visual appeal. A few whimsical touches—like a large anchor, a photo pod capsule that hints at future upgrades, and some 100-yen binoculars—add layers of interactivity to the site. Nature-wise, although the flowers had passed their prime when I visited, buzzing bees and coastal breezes still made for an atmospheric stroll.\n\nWhile it’s true that many of the summit’s photo spots offer variations of the same vantage point, they’re so arrestingly beautiful that you really won’t mind. The entire experience is well-paced, scenic, and respectful of both history and hospitality.\n\nIn sum: Mt. Nesugata’s summit is worth more than just a few photos—it’s a place to slow down, learn a little, breathe deeply, and perhaps most pleasantly, eat very well while doing so (at The Royal House restaurant). A recommended stop for those exploring Shimoda and seeking something both scenic and soulful.",
      "Gives a beautiful view of Izu peninsula.\nYou need to hike up to see more beautiful views",
      "Beautiful volcano top with a good view of the Shimoda bay. Nice garden too. Worth spending an hour here."

      "If you like capybara‘s, this is the place to go. I’ve been to a capybara Café before but this zoo cannot compare. You get to feed the capybara. You get to touch them. There’s like 40 of them if not more and even the other animals in the other part of the zoo is worth the visit. It is super unique and really really cool experience. You have a lot of rabbits and other animals that you’re also get to pet and feed. You can also go up Mount Otoru nearby and walk around there. This area is really lovely and it is worth a visit.",
      "I’ve been to this zoo before, and one of the highlights was getting to see the capybaras taking a bath. We also had the chance to feed them, which was a fun and memorable experience. The zoo is a bit out of the way, but you can buy food there and feed many of the animals, making the trip well worth it.\n\nI came back to experience it again, but I wouldn’t recommend visiting during the summer. The heat makes the animal smells much stronger, which can be quite unpleasant. Visiting during a cooler season would make the experience far more enjoyable.",
      "If you’ve just ridden the Mt. Omuro cable car (the tram that takes you to the top of the grassy volcano), turn around and walk literally across the road — that’s where you’ll find Izu Shaboten Zoo. It’s the perfect laid-back half-day activity after the view from the summit.\n\nThis isn’t one of those massive, exhausting zoos. It’s compact, shady, and genuinely cozy. On the weekday I visited, it felt almost private — hardly any crowds, just the sound of gravel underfoot and the occasional peacock screech.\n\nOf course, the undisputed stars are the capybaras. They have a huge outdoor area with a hot-spring bath (yes, the capybaras actually soak in an onsen in winter — adorable doesn’t even begin to cover it). Even in summer they’re ridiculously chill, lounging in the water or munching grass while visitors watch in quiet awe.\n\nOther highlights:\n•  Free-roaming peacocks that follow you around like they own the place (one decided to walk with me for a solid ten minutes — best escort ever).\n•  A fantastic walk-through bird zone where flamingos, sacred ibis, ducks, geese, and spoonbills wander right past your feet. No cages, just a big netted area — you really feel like you’ve stepped into their world.\n•  Classic zoo lineup done well: cheeky otters, wallabies, antelopes, donkeys, turkeys, parrots, even a few lazy sloths hanging in the greenhouse section.\n\nMy only tiny disappointment was that the shoebill wasn’t on display the day I went (apparently he sometimes takes “days off” inside). Next time!\n\nEverything feels lovingly maintained, the paths are easy, there are plenty of benches in the shade, and the whole vibe is relaxed and happy. Combine it with the cable car and the cactus greenhouse (the “shaboten” part of the name) next door, and you’ve got yourself a perfect easygoing afternoon on the Izu Plateau.",
      "Zoos in Japan can apparently be notoriously bad in terms on animal welfare standards. This one was good in some ways/parts, bad in others. It is quite a large zoo, with many different areas, and glasshouses for lots of different plants. It seems that thought and care has gone into making some of the outdoor enclosures feel natural and enriching for the animals. Places like the walkthrough enclosures and free roaming animals (the bird paradise, the wallabies, farm animals, around the lake, the peacocks) were mostly good as it was the people that were kept to a small portion, not the animals, who had sufficient space to do their own thing. Although the kangaroos seemed perhaps drugged (eyes closed) to make them docile around humans which isn't good if so. The capybara onsen was great, and it was nice to feed the capybara in other parts of the park, although the keepers were prodding them around unnecessarily. But this zoo just had too many animals to house and care for them all sufficiently. The largest animals (giraffes, tapirs?) didnt really have enough space. In particular the animals kept in small indoor tanks/enclosures seemed stressed and unhappy. I'm not sure if they were indoors just for the winter cold weather (some of the outdoor animals seemed a bit chilly) or at all times of year. The fact that visitors can feed them seems with some animals be a bad idea because the animals with not much else to do then end up unnaturally begging for food from all visitors, and its quite sad (binturong, cloud rats). In particular the indoor-only primates seemed unhappy (marmosets, lemurs in cage). I'm not sure if perhaps they were being kept indoors because they were ill and needed monitoring or if this was where they spent all their time. The zoo should reduce the number of animals, rehoming some of those who don't have enough space or things to do (particularly the mammals- monkeys, kangaroos, large animals like giraffes and tapirs), giving more space to others and focus on the ones that are more suited to the areas and to being in a captivity (amphibians, reptiles, birds, farm animals, very chill animals like capybara ).",
      "If you love capybaras, Izu Shaboten Zoo is the place to go. Seeing the capybaras in winter, quietly soaking in their yuzu baths, was such a simple joy.\n\nThe zoo has a very laid back, open feel, making it easy to wander around and enjoy the animals at your own pace. On top of that, there was a fantastic view of Mount Fuji from the zoo, which made the whole experience feel even more special."

The sand is soft and the water is fairly shallow and calm. It is very nice to come at night for the illuminations. There were also many families doing fireworks in the sand. There are coin lockers, toilets, showers and footwashes (free), and dumpsters on the beach for trash.",

Probably it’s the last day of the holiday, local people need to go work the next day. We went there in late November, a bit chilling at night so better dress warm for the weather",
      "A beach popular with locals as well as tourists to Atami. There is a breakwater promenade on the south side if the beach, hosting a pier for recreational boats, and is a nice place to sit and relax in the evenings. The sun is strongest here in the mornings, given that it faces east.",

      "Atami Castle is located on a higher ground at Atami, relatively small compared to other castles such as Nagoya Castle, Matsumoto Castle, etc. It is not really for its architecture, but for its ocean view, castle museum exhibiting most (if not all) castles in Japan, exhibitions, which are pretty interesting too. We spent almost 1.5 hours (slow pace) at the castle. The entrance fee is 1200 yen per person. We took the ropeway (cable car) up to the castle.",
      "Jan 18, 2026\nPassed by on the way to Hihokan but didn’t enter. Didn’t look too bad but I can see how it can stand pale compared to other historically rich castles. The trick art museum aspect didn’t draw me in either. ¥1,200 for a ticket to either the castle or the trick art museum or ¥2,000 for a combo ticket.",
      "We really enjoyed all of the model's and history of japanese castles. The views are stunning.   Taking the rope way up is very unique. Skip the 3rd floor folks...If there's a trap... it's this one",
      "The view from this tourist castle is nice.  And the samurai museum is cool. But remember this was created I the 1950's to attract tourists so it's not a real castle.\nThere's plenty of parking if you drive right up to the castle.",
      "Even though it's an old Japanese-style castle, I wondered why the inside wasn't cramped, and it seems to be because the building was constructed in 1958. Floors 1 to 5 are museums, and the 6th floor is an observation deck. The first basement floor had a free arcade, which I really liked because unlike the arcades outside where you have to insert a coin every time you die in a game, here you could play the arcade machines for free without limit."

      "The Vibrant Charm of Katsuo-ji\n​The temple grounds are a breathtaking blend of spiritual tradition and natural splendor. Everywhere you turn, thousands of bright crimson Daruma dolls peek out from stone walls, bridge railings, and wooden shelves, their wide-eyed expressions creating a playful yet powerful atmosphere of perseverance.\n​The contrast between the bold red lacquer of the dolls and the muted, earthy tones of the surrounding forest is particularly striking. In the winter, as seen in your photos, a light dusting of snow adds a quiet, magical layer to the landscape, making the \"Winner's Luck\" charms stand out even more vividly against the misty mountains.\n​The centerpiece of the temple is its expansive koi pond, where the mist often rolls over the water, reflecting the elegant bridges and the distant pagoda. It is a place where every corner feels like a carefully composed painting—a perfect harmony of man-made devotion and the wild beauty of the Osaka hills.\n​Key Highlights from your photos:\n​The Daruma Shelves: A mountain of luck, showing the sheer scale of the prayers left behind by visitors.\n​The Lakeside View: The tiny Daruma \"omikuji\" (fortune) dolls perched on rocks by the water create a whimsical, miniature world.\n​The Atmosphere: The snowy, overcast sky provides a soft, atmospheric light that enhances the spiritual and tranquil mood of the temple.",
      "We pulled up to Katsuoji Temple kinda late in the day and low key thought we’d already missed peak autumn season.but NOPE. This place came through with the brightest, most gorgeous fall colors we saw our whole trip. Absolute slay 🍁🔥\n\nFrom the station you’ll need to hop on a bus to reach the temple. We went on a weekday and it was still crowded everyone  was taking pictures. But we still managed to get our shots, so don’t stress. Worth it.\n\nThe entrance ticket includes a postcard you stamp along the way, and once you’re done you end up with a super cute completed one. Loved that little experience. There are also souvenirs (the daruma dolls are a whole vibe), and the day we went there was even a stall selling castella cake. Say less.\n\nOverall? Peaceful, stunning, and totally unforgettable. If you’re chasing autumn leaves in Japan this is THE spot. Highly recommended 🙌✨",
      "One of the most beautiful and authentic temples for me. The walk is easy, the gardens beautiful, the lake calm and overall the whole experience is very inspiring for the soul. I especially liked what daruma dolls represent. Recommend going in the mornings and buy ticket online in advance in order to skip the lines and not wait for too long. The mountains are beautiful so if you have a day- make sure to include a nice nature walk",
      "I thought getting here would be difficult, but it’s actually very easy. The bus stop is right near the train station, and buses run often.\n\nTip: Make sure your IC card has enough balance for a round trip (about 1,600 yen). There is no place to top up at the temple.\n\nInside the temple, there’s a lot of walking, but every corner is beautiful. You can easily take over 300 photos. Besides the fun of collecting stamps (you have to walk around the temple to complete them), it’s also entertaining to observe how people place Daruma dolls everywhere—some spots are honestly quite funny.\n\nI recommend spending 2–3 hours here. I liked this temple more than Kiyomizu-dera because it’s less crowded and more peaceful.",
      "A truly peaceful and unforgettable place.\n\nKatsuoji is absolutely beautiful, and visiting while snow falls makes the experience even more special. The temple grounds feel calm and reflective, with the quiet snowfall adding a sense of serenity and stillness throughout the area.\n\nThe contrast between the vibrant temple buildings and the snow is stunning, and walking through the grounds encourages a slower, more mindful pace. The atmosphere feels both grounding and inspiring, making it easy to appreciate the surroundings and the moment.\n\nFor anyone seeking a peaceful, scenic, and atmospheric destination, Katsuoji is well worth a visit. Seeing it covered in snow creates a magical experience that leaves a lasting impression."

We didn't stay long enough to venture out of the historical district but I suspect that Kurashiki has more to offer than this nice little spot.",

Accessible directly from Osaka but I chose to stay a night in Kurashiki to enjoy the area.\n\nThe canal is beautiful with historical buildings alongside it, you’d spot swans swimming there as well.

      "🌟 \"A charming blend of history, culture, and canals — Bikan Historical Quarter\"\nBikan Historical Quarter in Kurashiki is a true step back in time, where beautiful Japanese wooden buildings meet elegant touches of European architecture. Strolling along the scenic canal, with its willow trees and peaceful atmosphere, feels like walking through a living postcard.\n\nThe streets are lined with unique souvenir shops, perfect for finding special gifts, as well as cozy cafés and restaurants to relax and enjoy a coffee or a meal. The area is also impressively wheelchair-friendly, making it easy for everyone to explore at their own pace.\n\nTip: Take your time here — the magic is in the slow walk, soaking in the details, and letting the blend of history and nature work its charm. A must-visit when you visit Japan!"

The station is clean, compact, and easy to navigate, with staff guiding visitors smoothly between platforms. Even during steady foot traffic, the atmosphere stays relaxed, and the surrounding mountain air gives the place a refreshing feel.\n\nWhile it’s not a major attraction on its own, Sōunzan Station works well as a starting or ending point for exploring the higher elevations of Hakone. The views from the outdoor areas are surprisingly nice, especially on clear days, and the layout makes transfers quick. It earns a 4 out of 5 for convenience, cleanliness, and the gentle mountain ambiance.",

It's quite a little gem esp. if you can manage to visit during a cooler day.",
      "It is difficult to categorize this facility with anything. The facility itself is art, the location is art, the ancient Japanese artifacts are art, and the fusion of these elements makes for a special experience. The cherry blossoms and rape blossoms were in full bloom, creating an Amazing landscape. The three hours are in the morning and afternoon, but the three hours go by quickly. Reservations are required through the website."

      "Beautiful museum! Lovely installations in the outdoors that play with the natural sunlight, and plenty of beautiful art pieces on display indoors. I went in December so there was a big winter tree that started to shine beautifully with the natural sunlight as the sun started to set. There is a good Italian cafe, too, and at that time there was live music performance by musicians from Italy. Worth a visit for anyone into Italian art, as the whole place felt like a slice of Italy in the woods of Japan with an astonishing view of mountains and hot springs. That said, I think it's best to visit during spring or autumn time instead of December as the lack of natural flowers and greenery was apparent in some exhibition areas.",
      "📍 Hakone Venetian Glass Museum (Glass Forest)\n箱根ガラスの森美術館 @ Hakone, Japan 🇯🇵\n\nVisited on 20 November 2025 at 4pm.\nThe Hakone Venetian Glass Museum features beautiful Venetian glass set among a charming garden. The outdoor Glass Forest ✨ sparkled in the soft evening light, and the glowing glass Christmas tree 🎄 added a magical festive touch. The surrounding autumn leaves 🍁 created a stunning contrast with the shimmering glass, making the garden feel warm, colorful, and enchanting.\n\nInside, the museum displays delicate Venetian glass pieces and elegant artworks inspired by classic Italian craftsmanship. The crystal arches and pathways offer peaceful, fairy-tale scenery perfect for photos.\n\nA sparkling and romantic Hakone spot — Venetian glass, autumn leaves, and a glowing Christmas tree. ✨🍁🎄🏛️",
      "An adventurous bus ride from Hakone into the hills. The entry fee is 1800 yen. Some amazing pieces in the collection. Many nice images to take on a sunny day. The shop there is large and a cool Eki stamp as you enter. Well worth the journey.",
      "This is definitely worth a stop.  I was lucky to be there in November when the holiday lights were up.  The whole place was glowing and sparkling.  The gift shop is very large, and feels like an extension of the museum.",
      "A must see if you love art nouveau and Lalique. A fine collection in Japan adding some culture sightseeing. Beautiful garden and cafe as well as a unique one of a kind gift shop."

      "Visiting Hakone Shrine on a weekday made the entire experience feel calm and unhurried. There was no wait to enter, and the walk through the tall cedar trees immediately set a peaceful tone. The path leading up to the shrine is beautifully maintained, and the atmosphere feels respectful without being overly crowded or commercial. Even with a few visitors around, there was plenty of space to pause, take in the surroundings, and appreciate the history of the site. The shrine buildings themselves are elegant and understated, blending naturally into the forest setting. I didn’t need to buy tickets in advance, and everything felt straightforward and accessible.\n\nWhat stood out most was how grounding the entire visit felt. The combination of nature, tradition, and quiet moments made it easy to slow down and reflect. It’s a great stop for anyone wanting to experience the spiritual side of Hakone without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. The area around the shrine is also easy to explore, with clear paths and scenic viewpoints that add to the experience. Whether you’re traveling solo or with others, it’s a place that invites you to take your time and enjoy the stillness.",
      "📍 Hakone Shrine 箱根神社\n@ Hakone, Japan 🇯🇵\n\nVisited on 20 November 2025.\nHakone Shrine is a peaceful, spiritual place surrounded by tall cedar trees and a refreshing forest atmosphere. The bright red shrine buildings and stone steps create a sacred, beautiful setting. It’s also known as a popular power spot, where many visitors come to pray for good fortune and blessings.\n\nThe walk through the quiet forest felt calming, and the shrine was well-maintained and welcoming. Together with the nearby Heiwa-no-Torii, it’s one of Hakone’s must-visit spots.\n\nA serene and meaningful shrine — beautiful forest path, sacred atmosphere, and a famous power spot in Hakone. ⛩️🌿✨",
      "Little bit of a climb up the steps, but we'll worth it.  There are a few shrines throughout the area, but this is the largest of the bunch.  You can go up and make your offerings.  Set in the forest, very beautiful.  The cedar trees are humongous, just amazing.  The parking lot is not that far away.  There is also a small path you can follow instead of the steps.  It's just so peaceful and scenic, a must stop.",
      "2nd shrine to visit in Japan and was not expecting to be as large as it was. Took car ride all the way from Tokyo and you could see a huge lake before climing to the top of the shrine. They also have a Soba shop in the parking area so was able to enjoy a nice hot meal before leaving",
      "Hakone Shrine is a magical and atmospheric place.\nHidden among tall cedar trees and surrounded by nature, the shrine feels mysterious and deeply spiritual. The walk to the temple is already part of the experience.\nTruly one of the most evocative spots in Hakone."

      "Kōdai‑ji Temple in Kyoto offers one of the most refined blends of history, artistry, and atmosphere among the city’s many heritage sites. Founded in 1606 by Nene in memory of her husband, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the temple carries a quiet emotional weight that becomes apparent as you move through its grounds. The craftsmanship is exceptional, delicate screens, and carefully preserved structures reflect the aesthetic sensibilities of the Momoyama period without feeling overly staged.\n\nThe strolling garden is the highlight. Designed by the legendary Kobori Enshū, it unfolds in a series of elegant scenes: reflective ponds, stone arrangements, and pathways that guide you through shifting perspectives. Even with other visitors around, the garden maintains a sense of calm that encourages you to slow down and absorb the details. In autumn, the illuminated night displays transform the space into something almost ethereal, with maple leaves glowing against the water.\n\nThe bamboo grove, though smaller than Arashiyama’s, is more intimate and far less chaotic. It feels curated for contemplation rather than photography, which adds to the temple’s overall sense of balance and restraint.",
      "One of my favorite temple visit in Kyoto. Yes very touristy, but I don't mind. I bought the temple entrance ticket bundle with Entokuin ticket and museum ticket. I visited during momiji season so the scenery and view is very beautiful. There was a small pond and the visiting route were clearly marked for guidance to the tourist. The temple ground is quite big there are some hilly area, slopes and stairs, so just be aware if you have weak knees.  You can just also relax and walk around the flat area. This temple also has a section with bamboo forest if you want to avoid crowd in Arashiyama. I visited late noon so there's quite a lot of people there waiting for the night illumination as well.",
      "Kodaiji Temple Night Illumination Review\n\nKodaiji Temple’s nighttime illumination was one of the most breathtaking experiences of our Kyoto trip. The entire garden comes alive after dark — fall trees glowing with soft spotlights, colors looking even richer and brighter, and a gentle light show projected near the temple that adds to the atmosphere without feeling overwhelming.\n\nThe walk through the grounds felt serene and almost magical. There’s a small bamboo forest here, and with the lights shining upward, the bamboo looked like it was glowing from within. Every corner felt peaceful, quiet, and beautifully designed to highlight the natural surroundings.\n\nIf you’re in Kyoto during the illumination season, this is an absolute must-see. It turns an already beautiful temple into a completely unforgettable evening experience.",
      "We went to visit the temple in the afternoon (at around 6pm) and we loved that there were not too many people. The place (and the park) is really nice. It was especially nice with all the autumn colors and lightning that makes the colors even more beautiful.\n\nWe also saw one of the lightning shows that the Kyoto city prepares at different temples. It was okay but it was nothing to special. But the place itself is really nice.",
      "A lovely temple with several buildings over a spacious garden. It’s very popular with many tourists: I saw three buses in the parking lot, but it’s spacious enough that it didn’t feel crowded. It’s on a slight hill so you can go up stairs and paths up into slight wooded areas. There is a small bamboo thicket that you can pass through to get the feeling of a bamboo forest. One of the buildings requires removing your shoes to explore. There is another building where you can sit & take some tea for an extra fee. I explored this place alone, and enjoyed it a lot. It was verdant and the air was refreshing. This is one of those destinations where people take photos in their rented kimono outfits, which seemed odd to me. As a western female redhead it would never occur to me to do that but there were lots who did. There are several rental shops nearby. I took a city bus to get to the temple which was easy and inexpensive."

      "Came here late at night around 10PM for some Japanese BBQ! Staff were super nice and welcoming and even handed us an English menu since our Japanese was very minimal. Food was fantastic usually we’re used to cooking the meat ourselves but the staff ended up cooking and cutting for us(we think cause we ordered a thick cut of meat). Prices was great for the atmosphere. Lots of local and we can tell the place was authentic. Would recommend reserving first! Great restaurant, great staff!",
      "Came here at late 7pm but was told to return at 8.45pm for a table. Hung out nearby for a drink before returning.\nIt is a cosy space and certainly has its own vibes.\n\nOrdered the 5 kinds wagyu assortment, tongue cuts platter and a cold noodle (akin to a Korean naengmyeon).\nMeat was great, fresh and tender. Noodle was fine (came for the meat not noodle).\n\nNo complaints about service, but just sharing some points:\nDidn’t realise they had an English menu until after we ordered - managed to cope with ordering but obviously challenged by language. You will also have to cook the meat yourself.\n\nVibes was great, obviously catering to the after work crowd from offices nearby.\n\nWould come back again for the meat and drinks.",
      "My party of 4 was looking for somewhere to eat after a long day. We were able to make reservations here and were quickly escorted to our table. The staff, especially Thet, did a great job of giving us advice on what to order and providing recommendations! We especially loved the skirt steak and the beef short ribs! The side dishes were delicious also - we got the bean sprout salad and assorted kimchi. They helped us cook the meats so they were perfect and cleaned the grill regularly. The staff was so nice and the vibes were great! Price was very reasonable for the great quality of meat - will definitely be back the next time I’m in Tokyo!",
      "Went for dinner, had a little trouble find it this gem, Was offered an english menu upon arrival, service was awesome, food was amazing! Will be back! Thank you for the kind service!",
      "The meat here just tastes so good. We got mainly from the set with a few a la carte. The set price itself is quite affordable and the portions are okay. There is a variety of meat offered.\n\nThere’s an English menu, just have to ask for it, and the staff are quite proficient in English too. Also super helpful in guiding you on whether you over-ordered or if you’d be good to get more."

      "Probably the best spot for snorkeling around Kanto area. However, you need to get to the port really early like 5am to get a parking lot and put your stuff to secure your spot in a line for a boat.\nAlso, there will be so many people in a small area. A sand area is very limited. Other space is stones and rocks. You must take your chairs and/or air mat.\nJapanese people like to stay in tents so they’ll block your view.",
      "Superb...\nExcellent snorkling site outside Okinawa.\nDuring peak season this tiny beach will be horrible crowded but at the end of season (September) this tiny beach almost like private beach.\nRocky beach has Crystal visibility, plenty various of coral fishes.\nMarine boot is mandatory, except rock and other sharp objects the beach also has many poisonous Stone fish.\nAbsolutely recommend",
      "The snorkeling area is nice as it's an enclosed area surrounded mostly by rocks. You need to get quite a bit out to be deep enough to swim. You will definitely need some shoes for the water as there's sea urchins and sharp rocks that I would not suggest walking barefoot on. Once you're further out though, the water and marine life is really nice.\n\nBiggest negative is how crowded it is and having to arrive super early in the morning for parking. Most cars started waiting as early as 3am to get a parking spot. Then there's a lot of waiting until the boats start running at 8am with a huge queue of people waiting to board it. After arriving at the beach, everyone sets up their massive tents so it's a bit of a pain to walk and get around the rocks.",
      "Hirizo beach is a very nice “beach”, just made out of only rocks everywhere, very small and so easily crowded. The view is very nice and snorkeling activity is ok, but too many staffs yelling at you not to swim here or there . Include also 2000¥ boat trip for one person and 2 min transportation to the beach.",
      "That's incredible that you can find such a tropical place so relatively close to Tokyo. Arrived at Nakagi Port you can purchase for 1500 yen (as of 2018) a return transfer ticket, and boats are linking the bay every 5 minutes. However, beware the crowd of midsummer weekends. If possible go a little off season (like in mid September) and on a weekday."

      "This temple and whole town around it is really adorable. We tried some wasabi ice cream, and the hop&cold spring",

      "Visiting Kawazu Nanadaru (Kawazu Seven Waterfalls) was honestly one of the most refreshing experiences I’ve had in Japan. The moment I entered the trail, I felt surrounded by pure nature — the sound of water, the smell of the forest, and the cool air instantly relaxed me.\n\nThe walking path is beautiful and easy to follow. Each waterfall has its own charm, so every few minutes you get a new surprise. Some of them are small and cute, and others are powerful with water crashing down into a clear blue pool. I loved how peaceful the whole area felt — not too crowded, just the sound of nature.\n\nMy favorite part was how the trail becomes more and more scenic as you go deeper. The bridges, the stone steps, and the greenery everywhere make the walk feel almost like a little adventure. I stopped many times just to take photos because the waterfalls look different from each angle.\n\nThe air around the falls is so clean and cool, especially near the bigger waterfall where you can feel the mist on your face. It made me feel awake and refreshed. It’s also a great place if you want to take your time, walk slowly, and enjoy nature without rushing.\n\nThere are small cafés and shops near the starting point, and the atmosphere feels local and warm. The whole area has this calm countryside vibe that makes you want to stay longer.\n\nOverall, Kawazu Seven Waterfalls is a perfect choice if you want a peaceful and beautiful nature escape. The trails, the scenery, and the waterfalls all come together to create a really memorable experience. I would definitely visit again, maybe in another season, because I’m sure it looks different and beautiful every time.",
      "Kawazu Seven Waterfalls is for those who are nature lovers.  It’s quiet and serene.  We went early morning during the week and the forest was ours.  Take your time and enjoy the solitude.\nMostly paved paths with handrails and proper signage around, lots of photo ops, bathrooms and a stamps station along the walking trail near each waterfalls and even a spot for an honour system plants for sale. The wish-making rock toss into a basket was challenging and fun…I missed but still got my wish as I was already in Japan.\nWear proper clothing and shoes with good soles as some areas can be slippery.  You need at least a couple of hours to do the full hike.",
      "Beautiful area perfect for families. The path is paved and easily walkable. The path does have steps that go down to each waterfall so not suitable for strollers but having baby in carrier is great.\n\nStaying at the Nanadaru Onsen Hotel also gives you access to the cave Onsen near the main waterfall.\n\nThe air is fresh, walkway is clean, and waterfalls are beautiful. Definitely worth a visit if you’re nearby.",
      "Its very beautiful and serene but its quite a treck.\n\nLovely views overall and quite a nice shift from the busy citylife.\n\nThe village where the waterfalls are is also quite cozy with a very friendly shop and an amazing udon/soba restaurant serving cheap and amazingly delicious food.\n\nIf you have physical limitations or similar it could be dificult to treck through but its very beautiful for those who apreciate nature.",
      "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nAbsolutely breathtaking!\nKawazu Seven Waterfalls is one of the most beautiful and peaceful spots in Izu. The trail is easy to walk and perfectly maintained, winding through lush forest and crystal-clear streams. Each of the seven waterfalls has its own charm — from small cascades hidden among mossy rocks to the majestic final fall that feels straight out of a movie.\n\nThe sound of rushing water, birds singing, and the fresh mountain air make it such a relaxing experience. Along the way, there are lovely cafés and small onsen inns where you can stop and enjoy a break with coffee or soft-serve ice cream.\n\nIt’s also a great place to visit year-round — vibrant green in summer, fiery red leaves in autumn, and tranquil beauty in winter. If you’re in Izu, this is a must-see destination. Highly recommended for nature lovers, photographers, and anyone looking to unwind in Japan’s natural beauty. 🌿💧"

      "The weather wasn’t great, it was a rainy day, but I visited the oldest shrine in Izu. It was very quiet and peaceful.",
      "I went during the weekday so not much people were there. (And during the hot days lol)\nSo we got some amazing pictures and were able to take our time to check out the shrine (make sure to visit the seaside torii towards the beach)\nTo get to the torii there’s a path on the right as you’re heading towards the main shrine. (Hopefully that makes sense)",
      "Beautiful to see but somehow underwhelming! It seems smaller in person 🥲 It was still gorgeous and worth seeing. The weather was kind of bad so maybe it would have been more impressive with the sun shining down."

      "Very beautiful white sand beach that was not crowded. You can rent sunbeds and a parasol for the day for a reasonable price. Beach security and a few locals ladies were going around keeping the beach clean. There is a 7/11 just across the street, offering ice cold drinks, snacks and beach necessities. All in all a very relaxing experience.",
      "AWESOME beach. Be careful with the sun though, it’s easy to get completely fried here with no shade. Plan your trip accordingly as there is limited bus runs throughout the day. If you need drinks or anything else, there is a 7/11 right across from the bus stop.",
      "Beautiful beach. I guess I like it because I will never ever set my foot there in season! Love walking along the shore in October - November when sand barriers has been set up. Parking is a bit of a drag though.",
      "Shirahama Beach — just wow!\nWhite soft sand, crystal clear turquoise water and gorgeous views. The beach is well maintained, has everything you need. The atmosphere is calm, especially in the morning. A bit crowded in season, but still one of the best places to relax by the sea in Japan. Highly recommended! 🌊☀️",
      "Tattoo Friendly!  We saw so many people with them and no one minds.\n\nIts an amazing beach! Great quality sand and parking is on the beach.\nA side note about parking, they close the lots at 1600. We tried to find 24hr parking but had no luck. So try searching before you arrive!"

      "I came at 11 a.m. on August 15, 2025. I had to wait in line for about 1.5 hours for the chairlift, and it was incredibly hot with strong sun. Be sure to prepare for the long wait by bringing a hat, water, and a UV protection umbrella.\n\nOnce you're up there, the weather is clear, and the mountain is beautiful. The walk around the mountains takes about 20 to 30 minutes",
      "enjoyable hike around crater rim of dead volcano\nwith good view of mountain Fuji\nArchery at the base of the crater was funny",
      "Nice tourist spot, a fun little chair lift and , you can see the mt. fuji and the lovely ocean on a good day. Restaurant there are also lovely and delicious.",
      "You can see a crater that inspired a famous scene in Your Name. On clear days, Mt Fuji is viewable.",
      "It was beautiful even though we visited at the beginning of summer on a windy day. The chair lift costs 1,000 yen round trip, be sure to check the official website beforehand in case it’s not operating due to wind or other conditions. If you’re taking the bus, keep in mind that the last one doesn’t run late, so plan accordingly."

      "Let me start by discussing the parking lot. If you are there for a quick stop of less than five minutes, it’s free. However, over 5 minutes it costs 500 yen and that’s the max cost for the entire day. There are other spots nearby besides the bridge and lighthouse. As for the lighthouse and local souvenir shop, it closes at 04:30 pm. The bridge itself boasts some of the best views of peninsula. Absolutely stunning! Found and spoke to a couple of local fishermen who go here everyday. Some areas require a little more athleticism to climb, but the man trails are easy.",
      "Safe and easy to get to. Better to enjoy the coastal walk rather than driving straight there, if you have time. This is a popular attraction so you may need to wait at times as people take photos. The water here is very clear.",
      "It's a cool bridge but the great thing about it is that it's in such a  beautiful spot.  The views along the coast are awesome.  And the hike to it is not difficult and only took about 20 minutes.",
      "A must come by if you love nature, it is relaxing and amazing to see the rock formations here. Free admission and only pay for car park.",
      "10 minute walk from ito station, the bridge held a fun river race. Family oriented activity with refreshing water dips once the boat flipped over. Ito is calm and clean. The orange beach was refreshing too."

      "If you’re in a rental car and not familiar with Japanese driving, you want to be careful because getting to the New York map Museum and Garden or JogaSaki Coast can be tricky. The roads of residential sections are hard to follow on Google maps and the roads are narrow. So check the map and use the biggest roads. Walking between the New York that museum and the lighthouse is very beautiful. I would say in July in August it’s going to be very hot so you should have water to drink and go early or later when it’s a little bit cooler. If you are not used to actual hiking, you should choose wisely. There are two parallel trails for most of the hike. The trail closer to the coast/water is up and down, steep, with step lots of steps and more rocks. The shorter, easier trail is fairly level with only a few places that are rocky or muddy. You have to watch your footing you should have shoes made for walking or hiking and if you’re elderly and have knee problems, hip problems, balance problems you might not want to risk either trail. The easier trail further from the water is only about 1 km or 6/10 of a mile so if you’re in recently good shape, you can consider taking it. You can drive from one spot to the other and just pay for parking.  The New York lamp museum area has ice cream and other treats and some light food and good bathrooms and a cafe. Both the lamps and the flowers are well worth the price of admission. On weekends and holidays and most of the summer, Both areas are quite crowded. Well worth a visit though. If you walk from the station, especially in warmer weather, you should get something to drink to hydrate along the way.",
      "Fabulous scenery and a wonderful place to spend an hour or three. Parking is fixed at 500 yen and goes to preserve the site. Be careful around the rocks, at the lighthouse there are unprotected areas, keep an eye on your kids. Well worth the visit! Winds here can be brutal...",
      "This place was gorgeous.\nFrom the train station it was about 30-35 minute walk to the start point of the hike. The hike wasn’t too bad, it was short and easy. Probably like 20-25 minutes to the bridge. Depending on how fast you walk. But overall it was beautiful and would definitely go back.",
      "We couldn’t go up Mount Omuro due to strong winds so it was great that we could view it from afar from the lighthouse. Lovely coastal views with no crowd. Do stop by when in the area especially if driving.",
      "Absolutely beautiful views! The drive up wasn’t bad at all—though it did get a little crowded in some areas. That said, there are plenty of spots where you can venture off and enjoy the scenery without so many people around."

      "Sōunzan Station is a calm and efficient transition point between the Hakone Tozan Cable Car and the Ropeway, and it feels like a natural pause before the scenery becomes more dramatic. The station is clean, compact, and easy to navigate, with staff guiding visitors smoothly between platforms. Even during steady foot traffic, the atmosphere stays relaxed, and the surrounding mountain air gives the place a refreshing feel.\n\nWhile it’s not a major attraction on its own, Sōunzan Station works well as a starting or ending point for exploring the higher elevations of Hakone. The views from the outdoor areas are surprisingly nice, especially on clear days, and the layout makes transfers quick. It earns a 4 out of 5 for convenience, cleanliness, and the gentle mountain ambiance.",

      "The Ōwakudani Information Center is a compact but helpful stop for anyone wanting context behind the volcanic activity. It offers simple displays explaining the geology, the history of eruptions, and why the valley produces its famous black eggs. The space is easy to walk through, and there’s no pressure to spend long — it’s more of a quick educational boost than a full museum. On a weekday, there was no wait at all, making it an effortless addition to the visit.\n\nWhat stands out is how the center adds meaning to what you see outside. After reading the explanations, the steam vents and sulfur clouds feel less like scenery and more like a living geological process. It’s not flashy, but it’s informative and grounding. For travelers who appreciate understanding the “why” behind a place, it’s a worthwhile stop. I’d rate it 4 out of 5 for clarity, accessibility, and enhancing the overall experience.",
      "We reached Owakudani from Hakone-Yumoto Station using a combination of train, cable car, and ropeway. The ropeway was especially exciting for me, as we could see Mt. Fuji partially covered by clouds but still visible. From Owakudani Station, the main volcanic area is about a 10-minute walk. One of the highlights was trying the famous black eggs, which are hard-boiled in the volcanically heated waters. Their shells turn black due to a chemical reaction with the hot spring minerals, and legend says eating one adds seven years to your life. Although the shells look unusual, the inside is just a normal boiled egg. We didn’t see them being cooked, but they’re sold ready-made nearby. As expected, they tasted just like regular eggs—only with a much more memorable appearance.\nOwakudani was formed by a volcanic eruption over 3,000 years ago, and it’s basically a dramatic valley full of steam vents and hot springs. It’s one of the most popular spots in Hakone because of its unique, almost otherworldly scenery—and if the weather’s good, you can even see Mt. Fuji peeking through. Just a heads-up: sometimes the area closes because of volcanic gases, so it’s worth checking before you go.",
      "The site is huge, and the view is stunning!\nThere’s also a really cheap museum you can visit for 100 yen.\nThe ropeway is a bit expensive, and the wait can be long depending on the time of day—be prepared to wait.\nBeware of traffic jams on the way up the mountain!",
      "We had an excellent experience at Owakudani. The landscape is incredible—sulfur vents steaming all around, the smell of the volcano in the air, and if you’re lucky with clear weather, amazing Mt. Fuji views. The highlight was trying the famous black eggs—warm, tasty, and fun to share (plus the local legend of adding seven years to your life makes it even better). Shops and facilities were clean, staff were kind, and everything felt organized. Truly a unique stop in Hakone.\n\nPro tips:\n•\tWeekdays are calmer → much less crowded and easier to enjoy the views.\n•\tCheck the weather → Mt. Fuji is visible only on clear days; worth planning around.\n•\tBlack eggs → sold in 5-packs, perfect for sharing with family/friends.\n•\tBring a jacket → it’s cooler and windy up here compared to Hakone town.\n•\tRopeway check → sometimes it closes due to volcanic gases or strong winds, so confirm before heading up.",
      "Top views here! We headed straight to look at the sulphur fields and had stunning views over the whole area. Then down to the parking lot, where you get the best and unobstructed views from Mt. Fuji if the weather is your friend. A nice gimmick are the black eggs cooked in the sulphur springs, which are said to prolong your life."

      "The Hakone Checkpoint (箱根関所, Hakone Sekisho) is a historic site located in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It was once an important checkpoint during the Edo period (1603–1868) and was part of the Tokugawa shogunate’s system of control to monitor and regulate travelers, particularly to prevent the movement of women from the shogun’s family and samurai. Here’s a review of the site:\n\nOverview and Historical Significance\n•\tThe Hakone Checkpoint was established in 1619 on the Tōkaidō, the most important route connecting Edo (modern-day Tokyo) with Kyoto, the capital at the time. It was a key part of the Shogun’s network of checkpoints designed to maintain control over the samurai class and prevent rebellion. The checkpoint specifically controlled the passage of people, goods, and information across the mountain pass.\n•\tThe site features a replica of the original checkpoint station, and visitors can learn about the role it played in the Edo period’s transportation and governance. The original building was destroyed over time, but a reconstruction offers an immersive experience of what it would have looked like.\n\nVisitor Experience\n1.\tHistorical Exhibits: The site includes informative displays about life at the checkpoint, the role of guards, and the travel restrictions enforced during the Edo period. There are also costumes available for visitors to try on, which can make for a fun and interactive experience.\n2.\tReconstructed Checkpoint Building: The main attraction is the reconstructed checkpoint building, which looks quite authentic and offers a glimpse into the past. The building itself is not just a structure but a historical interpretation, so visitors can feel the weight of its historical importance.\n3.\tScenic Location: Situated in the beautiful Hakone area, the checkpoint is surrounded by lush greenery and is just a short distance from other notable attractions like the Hakone Shrine and the Hakone Open-Air Museum. The natural beauty of the area adds to the overall experience, especially if you’re visiting on a sunny day.\n4.\tAccess to Local History: The museum within the checkpoint also highlights various aspects of life during the Edo period, including tools, weapons, and documents related to the functioning of the checkpoint. This is especially valuable for history enthusiasts who want to understand how the Tokugawa shogunate governed its territories.\n\nPros:\n•\tEducational: The site provides valuable insight into the Edo period and the strategic importance of transportation and communication during that time.\n•\tInteractive: The option to dress in period clothing and see the original and replica items up close makes it a very engaging experience for those interested in history.\n•\tScenic: The beautiful location in Hakone provides a peaceful, historic atmosphere with stunning views of the surrounding nature.\n\nCons:\n•\tSmall Site: While the checkpoint is historically significant, the actual site is relatively small, so it may not take up too much time if you’re looking for a longer visit.\n•\tLimited in Scope: It’s focused mainly on the checkpoint’s role, which might not be enough for those looking for a broader view of Japan’s history or a deeper exploration of Hakone itself.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n•\tAutumn: The fall colors around Hakone are stunning, and the natural scenery around the checkpoint is even more impressive.\n•\tSpring: Cherry blossoms in the area are also breathtaking, and Hakone is less crowded compared to other spots during the peak tourist season.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nThe Hakone Checkpoint is a fascinating and well-maintained historical site. It offers a great opportunity to dive into a crucial piece of Japan’s Edo period history while enjoying the beauty of Hakone’s nature. If you’re a history buff or just someone who appreciates the traditional aspects of Japanese culture, it’s definitely worth a stop. However, if you’re short on time or not as interested in historical checkpoints, it might be worth combining the visit with nearby attractions to make the most of your time in Hakone.",
      "A fascinating glimpse into Japan’s history!\nHakone Checkpoint is a well-preserved historical site that gives you insight into the Edo period’s travel and security system. The museum and reconstructed buildings are informative and engaging, with displays that bring history to life. The location by Lake Ashi offers beautiful views, making it both educational and scenic. Perfect for history enthusiasts, families, or anyone exploring Hakone’s cultural attractions!",
      "A well organized historical fortress to secure this district. You can see lots of heritage stuffs and designated layout and artwork here. Good to take a look at this place after having the pirate boat cruising. Enjoy.",
      "Visited Hakone Checkpoint and really enjoyed stepping back in time! The reconstructed gates and guardhouses are super well done, and the small museum has lots of interesting historical details. The lookout point offers amazing views of Lake Ashi and the surrounding mountains. Easy to walk around and the staff are friendly. A great stop if you’re exploring Hakone—history buffs and casual visitors alike will enjoy it!",
      "Its important as tourist area before and still famous among locals and foreign tourist till now. Good place for photos, having meals, and shop some local souvenirs. Suitable for any group size or FIT since its open area for everyone to come and enjoy.  Promised amazing panoramic view ...Worth visit"

      "The restaurant is located in a quiet corner of a residential area. You can literally smell the burgers as you approach the restaurant.\nService was impeccable even though they were busy and almost full when we arrived. They were cheerful and attended to our requests promptly.\nWe sat in a tatami room where there were 3 tables. The 2 other groups ahead of us were waiting for their food.\nWe had a Box Burger each, plus fries (separate order), and beef tendon stew which was a special of the day.\nLet me start off with the beef tendon stew - it was simply delicious with a well balanced taste; like a comfort food. One of the best beef tendon stews we have eaten anywhere.\nNow for the burger - we would have liked it more if it was a little less salty and also if there were less lettuce in it. I do like vegetables, but found the large amount of lettuce and salt masked the taste and flavour of the wagyu beef patty. The fries were good.\nOverall a pretty good and filling meal.\nWe noticed that almost all the customers were foreigners. Unlike some Japanese restaurants which accepts cash only,  Box Burger does not accept cash....and indication that they cater mainly to foreigners.",
      "5 Word Review: DONT KEEP SEARCHING JUST GO\n\nYou ever lose a pick for a restaurant only so the other person could pick the one thing you really did not want to eat? That was me but boy was I glad I lost that pick! I walked to Box burger having ZERO desire to eat a burger and by the time I walked in I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into one!\n\nBox burger is a quaint but very beautiful restaurant that offers both traditional tatami seating as well as table and chairs (we opted for the former). Like almost every restaurant we went to the service was excellent, the restaurant was immaculate and the food was fresh and delicious.\n\nWe had the bacon and egg burger and the box burger along with an order of fries and onion rings. I also had the housemade lemon squash (soda). The fries and onion rings were some of the best I have had. Incredibly tasty and clearly made in house. The burgers were juicy and flavorful with just the right toppings and sauces. Overall this was one of the best burgers I have had anywhere.... made with local beef that supposedly has been raised drinking Onsen water.\n\nThe only tragedy is we didn't go twice before departing for the states.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this burger spot and if I ever go back to Hakone will be going back myself!",
      "Box Burger is a gorgeous and tiny burger joint in a traditional Japanese setting. There are two small dining rooms - one with about six chairs at bench tables and one tatami style room that seats about ten people on the floor. The burgers are high quality as are the fries, shakes and extras. The staff are fun and friendly. This is a burger experience worth having!",
      "Super friendly owner who can speak English. Onions rings were apparently the best my husband has ever eaten (I don’t eat them myself, but noted everyone else ordered & devoured them!). Great selection of burgers with local produce and beers from surrounding area. Highly recommend. Also cater to both vegetarian and vegans, which isn’t terribly common in Japan.",
      "What a lovely place! This was one of the best burgers I've had in my life (and definitely the best gluten-free one). The rice bun was quite soft and the burger extremely juicy. The staff is very sweet and you get to eat in a Japanese style room. Such a great experience!"

      "I was the first alone in line when I came around 8am. A couple came around 8:40am…by around 9am a few more people came. By 9:30am, you are risking not getting a chance of getting in. You can also try to rsvp online but that’s only open on Saturday at 9am for the following week.\nThe patron came out around 9:45am to ask us to order and pay, then go back waiting in line until actual opening time. It’s suppose to open at 11am but they let us in around 10:20am…\nHighly recommend you to have all your parties in line bcus if not, you will be asked to go in the back of line when the order/payment is done before restaurant opens.\nYes the wait was brutal, but the food really made up for it. Honestly one of the best ramen I ever had. The highlight was definitely the foie gras dumpling.",
      "I’m so happy we were able to get a reservation at Ginza Hachigou during our time in Tokyo. I had tried before we departed for our trip and the website crashed but was lucky enough to sneak us in for the second week we were there. Be prepared to move fast when you’re booking, it is seriously in high demand!\n\nWe got the last spot at 3:30 on a Friday, unfortunately they were out of the famous ravioli but it honestly didn’t matter. Hands down the best ramen I will ever have in my life. It’s such an enjoyable experience watching the chefs prepare it fresh right in front of you. It’s an intimate 6 person seating, so you can really just sit back and enjoy a master at work in a peaceful setting.\n\nAs I said the ramen itself is incredible, flavorful broth, delicious pork, and perfectly cooked noodles. I would eat 2 bowls if I had the option. We also got a side of their pork rice with horseradish and onion, and it was fantastic. Cannot recommend this place enough as a stop during your time in Tokyo, this was a highlight of our trip and I’m so glad we finished here on a high note.",
      "After trying for three years, I finally managed to secure a reservation at Ginza Hachigou, and it was well worth the wait.\n\nThe restaurant offers an intimate dining experience with only six seats, where the chefs prepare and cook directly in front of you. This creates a warm and engaging atmosphere that perfectly complements the attention to detail in every aspect of the meal.\n\nThe ramen broth was exceptional, rich, balanced, and deeply flavoursome, offering warmth and comfort with every bite. The use of a ravioli within the dish was truly unique and added a refined depth that elevated the overall experience.\n\nI would highly recommend.",
      "Honestly the most incredible ramen experience in all of Japan!\n\nIf you only have one bowl of ramen in Japan, have this ramen.\n\nI ate over 30 bowls of ramen in my 9 week trip to Japan and this simply triumphs them all - it really is the best.\n\nI visited twice!\n\nLet’s start with the broth - French technique clear duck consumé, light dashi/kombu with a depth of relentless umami. Light, powerful and perfectly balanced. What would you expect from a place that previously held a Michelin Star?\n\nBroth is not too oily, but has just the right amount of fat, presumably chicken fat, that it coats your mouth in the best warming and inviting way possible.\n\nThe noodles are cooked to absolute perfection - literally perfection to the very last second!\n\nStraight thin noodles complement the broth well, and it surprised me as I have visited Asahikawa on this trip and thought that shoyu ramen should be paired with curly fat noodles, how wrong I was.\n\nYou see.. the broth is neither shoyu nor shio, but simply a heavenly creation from the master. It’s modern, innovative and ultra refined.\n\nNow onto the toppings. The char siu is simply the best I’ve ever had! Super thick cut at almost 1cm thick, you almost struggle to hold it in the chopsticks, easily the best I had in Japan. You can see in my photos the perfect ratio of fat to meat.\n\nThe menma (bamboo shoots) are approx. 1cm x 1cm and have the perfect crunch. Never experience such good menma in my life.\n\nThe negi (green onions) are mild but somehow perfume the bowl with such beauty. I’m sure the owner sources the negi from Kyoto or somewhere of incredibly high standards.\n\nThe egg is simply perfect, soft and gooey on the inside it is simply cooked to perfection.\n\nThe foie gras and truffle ravioli is… how do I say this politely?… simply orgasmic. Did someone say tumescent? Subtle yet powerful, like a true love scene.\n\nThe last second crack of black pepper over the char siu complements the well-known “salt and pepper” taste so well, and is so aromatic that it’s almost the first aroma that hits you when the bowl is presented in front of you.\n\nThe service is impeccable! I dined here twice during my two weeks in Tokyo and both times I could not fault a single thing. On the second time I even asked to swap seats with the guest next to me so I could have the same seat again, that threw the cooking a seating arrangement out, but all staff did not make a fuss and completely accompanied me - THANK YOU 🙏\n\nFor the rice with char siu, negi (white part), horseradish and freshly cracked black pepper. My god was this good! The owner kindly advises to add some of the ramen broth at the end to create a wet rice bowl. My recommendation, be sure to order this too if you’re feeling hungry as it’s only an additional ¥500.\n\nNow that you have read all the way to here!\n\nHow to secure a seat?\n\nWell.. bookings online only open at 9am on Saturday, Tokyo time. Understandably the website crashes and the bookings are filled within a couple of minutes.\n\nThere is walk-in seating between 11am - 12pm for each day they are open. My suggestion, get there before 9am to avoid disappointment. If there are more than 18 people in line, you will most likely be turned away.\n\nThe restaurant seats 6. My understanding is that sometimes they open around 10:40am which gives customers approximately 20-30 minutes of seating time. After 12pm it is reserved for online reservations only.\n\nI hope this review assists you on your journey to the best bowl of ramen in Japan 😊\n\nGinza Hachigou, THANK YOU 🙏",
      "Ginza Hachigou is all about perfect harmony in a bowl. Every element blends together beautifully, creating balance without trying to be flashy. I really respect how the chef personally prepares everything with such care and precision. It’s not about showing off. It’s about consistency and mastery. When a place can maintain this level of quality every time, that’s true perfection."

      "We visited Jindaiji Temple for Hatsumode on a weekday, and were pleasantly surprised by how calm and uncrowded it felt. While many shrines and temples in Tokyo become overwhelmingly busy during the New Year period, Jindaiji offered a much more relaxed and local atmosphere.\n\nThe temple grounds are decently sized and easy to explore, surrounded by greenery that makes it feel far removed from the city despite being in Tokyo. There’s a strong neighborhood vibe here, with visitors strolling at an unhurried pace and families quietly paying their respects.\n\nOne of Jindaiji’s highlights is the area around the temple, which is famous for its soba shops. Many long-established restaurants serve handmade soba, making it a great place to enjoy a warm meal after your visit.\n\nIf you’re looking for a peaceful Hatsumode experience without the crowds, Jindaiji Temple is a wonderful choice. It combines tradition, food, and a welcoming local feel—perfect for starting the year on a calm and reflective note.",
      "Lovely temple located in a quiet neighbourhood. There's a path you can walk which brings you to the Botanic Garden. The temple is not that big but there are many points of interests to check out, look at the map.\n\nDon't miss out on the dango and soba (their specialty which you don't wanna miss).",
      "One of my fave places in Japan. Second time here. The soba is seriously good and everyone is so nice. Tons of keepsakes and the vibe is just so peaceful. Spread my ashes here when am gone",
      "Wonderful temple. It shows the old traditional side of Japan. It’s a hidden gem ! There are also good udon restaurants around the temple, but they close pretty early.",
      "Such a beautiful and historically significant Temple. The grounds are so beautiful with the botanical garden being adjacent. There's also good food that is both delicious and affordable out around the area. There are free maps with historical information for those who are interested."

Prices range from $18-$4500+ USD.  Isles are very narrow so be careful if you have a back pack on.  I will definitely come here again. They even had a section where you could personally decorate a music ornament with the supplies they had on hand.  If you like my review, please give it a thumbs up.",

      "Honestly, this was one of the best and most delicious dining experiences of my life.\nThe quality of the beef was exceptional — incredibly tender, juicy, and full of flavor. It truly melted in my mouth, and every single bite was amazing.\n\nThe staff were also wonderful — very attentive and provided excellent service throughout the entire meal.\n\nI’m so happy and truly grateful to have had the chance to dine here.

I highly recommend making a reservation in advance.\n\nI will definitely come back again when I have the chance.",
      "This will probably be one of your pricier meals but there aren't many better ways to enjoy yakiniku than this place. We each ordered the same set meal which did include some raw beef but they did inform us ahead of time. The grilled meat is cooked by staff in front of you so you can't mess up your own dish and burn it. Each serving highlighted the differences between cuts. The flavors and textures of each item varied and the sauce perfectly augments select items. The shaved ice at the end of the night was a nice, light way of finishing the meal. Our seating time was limited to 2 hours as they have set seatings every night. Drink order is mandatory too.",
      "Amazing wagyu experience. Every cut is served with care and grilled perfectly with staff guidance. The chateaubriand and shimofuri were unreal—melts-in-your-mouth level. Service is warm, professional, and the pacing of the meal is excellent. Pricey, but absolutely worth it for one of the best yakiniku meals in Tokyo.",
      "The meat quality is pretty insane. We got the truffle set and everything was good. However, the place was busy, and they tried to turn the tables quickly, so the whole experience felt a bit rushed. A reservation is definitely recommended, and you might need to make it even a month in advance. Their reservation online system opens on the first day of the previous month so you can reserve for the next month. With drinks, it was about 18000JPY per person. Overall, 8/10.",
      "Food is alright.\nService is of average - some staff were serving two tables, while other staff were just standing there chatting with each other. Some staff looked like they didn’t even want to be there.\nRestaurant is quite small in size and you can absolutely hear what people at the next table were talking about."

      "A Summer Escape to Sankeien Garden..\nIf you're looking for a peaceful break from the energy of Yokohama, you've to visit Sankeien Garden. I arrived arounf 11.30 qnd completely charmed by this place, especially in the summer (which a bit hot). It's not just a beautiful park; it's a collection of history, with a bunch of traditional buildings—old farmhouses, pagodas, even teahouses. I have walked through the paths felt like a journey back in time, with each new structure telling its own story against the backdrop of vibrant green.\nThe whole garden is designed so beautifully. The main pond is a big part of the experience, with the dense summer foliage creating perfect reflections on the water. I could have spent an hour just sitting there, watching the ducks and enjoying the quiet hum of cicadas. The paths wind around, leading you to hidden spots and incredible views. The lush, verdant trees create a natural shade that makes exploring even on a hot day incredibly pleasant.\n\nA little tip: make sure you find your way up to the Choshukaku Pavilion. It’s a bit of a slope, but the view is absolutely worth it. It’s the perfect spot to sit and take a moment to soak it all in. The front staff were all so welcoming and the price is affordable 👍🏻",
      "Beautiful garden, though one of the main houses was closed for a private event during our visit. Did quite a bit of walking within the garden but was well worth it. There’s a bus stop just outside the entrance so this made it very convenient to return to Yokohama station. Entrance fee was ¥900 for one adult.",
      "Sankeien (三溪園, or \"Three Creeks Garden\") is a renowned traditional Japanese-style garden in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Spanning 175,000 square meters (about 43 acres), it's celebrated for its serene landscapes, seasonal beauty, and collection of historic buildings relocated from across the country. Designated as a National Place of Scenic Beauty, it offers a peaceful escape with ponds, streams, winding paths, and vibrant foliage changes year-round.",
      "Agree to place to enjoy fall foliage at leisure. I suggest going to the garden in day afternoon, so that you can also enjoy the setting Sun right next to Mount Fuji in the observation Tower.",
      "Sankeien is absolutely breathtaking — a perfect blend of history, nature, and serenity. The garden is beautifully designed with wide ponds, winding paths, and traditional teahouses that make you feel like you’ve stepped back in time. The highlight for me was the three-storied pagoda perched on the hill, a stunning backdrop especially during cherry blossom and autumn seasons.\nEntrance is 900 for adults…"

      "Akarenga Park in Yokohama is a delightful urban oasis that seamlessly blends historical charm with modern leisure. As a visitor with an affinity for both culture and relaxation, I found this park to be a true gem in the heart of the city.\n\nThe park's centerpiece is the iconic Red Brick Warehouse, a remnant of Yokohama's rich maritime history. The historic architecture, coupled with the serene waterfront setting, creates a captivating ambiance that transports visitors back in time. The warehouse has been repurposed into a vibrant shopping and dining complex, adding a contemporary touch to the historical site.\n\nStrolling along the park's promenade, I was treated to stunning views of Yokohama Bay and the Yokohama Landmark Tower, adding to the picturesque allure of the location.\n\nAkarenga Park is a popular gathering spot for locals and tourists alike, offering a wide array of events and seasonal festivals throughout the year. The lively atmosphere, coupled with the lush greenery, provides a perfect setting for picnics and social gatherings.\n\nAs a culture enthusiast, I appreciated the occasional art exhibitions and performances that added an artistic flair to the park's offerings.\n\nIn conclusion, Akarenga Park in Yokohama is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a blend of history, leisure, and natural beauty. The harmonious integration of the Red Brick Warehouse's historical significance with the modern amenities and scenic waterfront creates an enchanting and dynamic experience. Whether you're exploring Yokohama or simply seeking a serene escape, Akarenga Park promises an unforgettable journey through the city's cultural and natural splendor.",

      "On Sept 23, 2025, my wife and I came to this waterfront park. Judging from the number of visitors and activities here, the Park was a popular one. We didn’t walk much but took a tour bus from a nearby station - we bought a one-day bus/train ticket for Yen700."

      "It’s a long walking distance from the World Porters but just beside the Chinatown to go here but the vibe here is different than other shopping street. I can feel the calmness of this shopping street compared to others that is famous among tourists. It’s good if you just want to stroll around it but there is not many things.",
      "The Motomachi Shopping Street in Yokohama is a good place to visit if you have time after visiting Yokohama Chinatown. The Motomachi Shopping Street is only a few minutes' walk across the bridge. Most of the stores and restaurants are much different than those in Chinatown. I found many shops, bakeries, and restaurants that interest me.",
      "Nice shopping street next to chinatown. Was here during winter and there was some nice illuminations around too. The street has lots of local and international brands.",
      "There is a great shop for Japanese Woodblock prints (M. Iishii and Sons) along with a large selection of traditional Japanese ceramics and wooden kitchen items. The shop  owners are welcoming and very knowledgeable about the process of woodblock printing. Iishii-San had a small book that he shared to teach us about the traditional process of woodblock printing. Beautiful selection of woodblock prints and having one as a memory of Japan is a treasure.  Check it out.",
      "Yokohama Motomachi Shopping Street\nReview on 15/4/2025\n\nIt was a cool, crisp evening — about half past six — with the sun sinking into the horizon and the temperature gently dropping. Leaving the comfort of our hotel, we embarked on a nostalgic journey toward Motomachi Shopping Streets, a place steeped in cherished memories for one of our traveling companions.\n\nThe city felt serene, almost ethereal, as we walked along the sparsely trafficked main road. Fairy lights twinkled softly on the shrubs, illuminating sections of the pavement and casting a magical glow. We passed the dark, mysterious street that led to Yokohama Chinatown, a tantalising glimpse into another world waiting to be explored.\n\nAfter about 25 minutes of walking, we arrived at our destination — the enchanting Motomachi Shopping Streets. Greeting us was a striking metal arch crowned with a phoenix-shaped sculpture, its gleaming figure symbolising renewal and prosperity. It stood as a beacon of promise, inviting us into a realm of discovery and elegance.\n\nThe streets themselves were like stepping into a storybook — no enclosed mall here, but open-air cobblestone pavements lined with charming boutique shops, cozy cafés, and tempting restaurants. The decorative streetlights cast warm halos over the pavement, blending Western sophistication with Japanese artistry to create a cosmopolitan haven.\n\nThe sky had turned into a blanket of midnight blue, and most of the shops had already closed for the day. Still, the architecture lining the streets captivated us — majestic buildings with distinctive non-Japanese styles, each telling a tale of Yokohama’s vibrant history.\n\nOur true quest came to light as we learned our companion’s purpose: to track down the elusive musical clock she had encountered 38 years ago. It was a bittersweet hunt, weaving past storefronts until we found ourselves at a corner 3-storey building specialising in jewelry, watches, and clocks. This store displayed a modest clock design with dotted lights on its external wall — simple yet striking, though far from the grandeur she remembered.\n\nThen came the moment we had anticipated — the clock began its performance. Its melody broke through the hushed streets, enchanting the air and transforming the ambiance into something magical. It was a long-awaited delight, an echo of the past that seemed to bridge decades in a fleeting instant.\n\nWith hearts full and spirits lifted by the melodic chimes, we turned toward the street leading to Yokohama Chinatown, ready to indulge in a dinner that would cap off an unforgettable evening. The journey was more than a stroll; it was a tapestry of memory, discovery, and quiet beauty."

      "I had a great time at Yokohama Chinatown where the food was delicious and the overall street design was truly impressive. I particularly loved the giant chicken which was only 500 yen and the ice cream for 400 yen was also a highlight. It was a pretty great experience and a wonderful place for a walk to enjoy all the different sights and flavors.",
      "Loved it. Go at night for the lovely lights and atmosphere. Felt very welcome. Lots and lots of food, sweets, and gift options. Easy to get to from Tokyo. It is very crowded but if you move off the main drag it gets a bit better. If/when I come back to Japan, I would really think about staying in this area.",
      "Very lively and colourful neighbourhood. Yet, not jam packed with tourists as in central Tokyo for example. You can actually walk and admire things here!\nMany restaurants and interesting shops and there’s a train station very nearby if you’re coming from central Tokyo.",
      "We looveee Yokohama.\n\nFirst of, like most if the tourists, we only planned to visit Chinatown. But once we arrived, we kinda got confused bc every shops sell food and souvenirs only. And the price is not cheap either. But worth trying.\n\nAfter decided to just try one of the restaurant, we headed to the brick building and want to see the ferries wheel. Instead of taking train or bus, we just walked. And that is the best way after all.\n\nWe found the city is so calm (prob bc it's sunday, so no workers or traffic). We like the buildings, the air, the harbour, and we bumped into an event, which we believed it for dogs. Bc everyone was bringing their dogs in costumes.\n\nWe didn't go to cup noodle museum or other attractions. Just enough for more than half day trip. Hope can be back someday bc we were in hurry to leave.",
      "Yokohama Chinatown is a vibrant and lively place that feels completely different from other parts of the city. The moment I entered, I was surrounded by colorful gates, bright signs, and the smell of delicious food coming from every direction.\nThere are countless Chinese restaurants, street food stalls, and small shops selling sweets and souvenirs. I tried steamed buns and dumplings, and everything tasted rich and authentic. Walking through the streets was exciting, with people chatting, taking photos, and enjoying the atmosphere.\nEven though it can get crowded, the energy of the area makes it enjoyable. It’s a great place to explore, eat, and experience a unique blend of Chinese and Japanese culture. I would definitely recommend visiting Yokohama Chinatown if you’re in the area."

      "I finally made it to Golden-Gai and I’m honestly obsessed. This was my first time visiting and even though I’m usually not a fan of crowded, loud party spaces, there is something so different about this place.\n\nThe vibe is just amazing. It’s a maze of tiny alleys and every single shop looks so cool and unique. It feels like stepping into a different era of Tokyo. I loved that there are so many different types of bars to choose from so you can really find a spot that fits your mood. I ended up trying an oden bar which was super cozy and then found this other bar that literally looked like a library.\n\nThe only real downside is that a lot of the bars have a cover charge or an additional seating fee, so just keep that in mind before you head in. But honestly, for the experience and the atmosphere, it’s totally worth it. Such a unique spot!",
      "THE MAZE WHERE EVERY DOOR IS A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE\n\n·\n\nVIBE CHECK\nthis is not a street, it's a living diorama of post-war tokyo. golden gai is a legendary network of six narrow alleys packed with over two hundred micro-bars, each with its own wild theme and personality. the vibe is historic, intimate, and incredibly cool.\n\nTHE BAR SCENE\nthis is where you find many cool small bars, some seating only a handful of people. it's about connection and curiosity. bar-hopping here feels like flipping through channels on the world's most interesting tv.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\ncome with an open mind and respectful curiosity. it's a unique, immersive dive into tokyo's soul. find a spot that calls to you, order a highball, and soak in the magic. an absolute must for an unforgettable night.\n\n·\n\npeep the images for your ref; they’re worth a thou.\n\nmake sure to ❤️!",
      "Golden Gai or Golden Town, in Shinjuku, is a small alley area, composed of 6 small lanes, where there are many small pubs, bars and small diners which often sell simple BBQ food, soup noodle, etc., in addition to liquor and wine.  In addition to eating and drinking, the area is also one of Japanese folk-art and other performing arts' birthplaces and later becomes a living center for many young performers and artists to manage their pub business and, at the same time, waiting for the acting, performing art opportunities.\n\nMany small pubs do have their own unique decorations inside and outside the stores, including posters, and it is worthy for tourists to take a walk of the area. If tourists want to take photos, then, day-time walk is recommended because not many customers in the area, and photo taking may be easier.\n\nMany bars or pubs in Golden Kai section have history of 40 years or longer, and a few of them do not accept foreign customers or tourists as their customers; generally, these bars or pubs prefer their frequent customers.\n\nBut a few pubs do open for all customers, including foreign tourists, such as Kenzo’s Bar [Bar owner is a playwriter and an actor, and he is very friendly and bar plays 1980s music], Bar Darling [perhaps because it is owned by a female actress, staffs are all female; the bar welcomes female customers, even single female], Ace’s [it does not impose cover charge and staffs can communicate English and welcome foreign tourists, and these bars do have reasonable pricing for drink and food.\n\nMost of the bars in Golden Kai do impose entrance fee, seating fee or cover charge per person, which is in the range of 500 Yen to $1,000 Yen per person, although there are few bars which do not have entrance fee pr cover charge.  Most of the bars open from later afternoon or early night, such as 08PM, although a few of the bars do open 24/7 daily.\n\nAlthough there are many bars in Golden Kai, the area does not allow public drinking or smoking in public section, and it is strictly enforced for the no smoking or drinking in public street rules.  However, most of the bars do allow smoking inside their bars.\n\n1st time foreign visitors or tourists, can take Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line [M Line] and get off at M-09 Shinjuku Sanchome Station and then walk to Exit 2, and the Golden Gai is in very short walking distance.",
      "Great Spot to go out for drinks in Shinjuku. It’s like a labyrinth of tiny cozy bars with a very local vibe. Most of them are foreigners-friendly. Either with friends or solo, you’ll always find some fun interesting people you can chat and share a drink with. Some bars have a small cover charge, others don’t but the drinks may be slightly more expensive. Most of them open around 5pm and can stay open till 5am, convenient for a barathon 😂 and to taste a different local drink in each bar. One of the few bars I’d avoid though is “Adieu l’ami”, they won’t tell you there’s a cover charge until the end (they had taken down the sign with the cover charge price the day I went) and the drinks are too expensive for what they are, I felt scammed.",
      "Really cool looking alleys with bars in them. For some reason it didnt feel like the friendliest place though, which felt unusual for my experience of Japan so far. Still some great photo opportunities at night time. Didn't go into a bar because im an introvert and it felt like I would have to speak to strangers as they so small. Would recommend a walk around here though. Was better than Omoide Yokocho."

      "A beautiful and vast shrine with a presence. The large tori gate greeting you as you enter the shrine makes this temple unique among the temple in Tokyo. When you enter the temple, you are greeted with a large public area with many sections to explore. Going near the end of the day is unique as you get to see the sun setting over the tori gate and the temple.",
      "It's beautiful. The shrine is dedicated to the respect of all those who died fighting for Japan from the Meiji Era onward. There is the shrine proper, the Yushukan a museum to preserve the memory of the kami, an archive, a beautiful garden and several monuments.\nThe shrine is very important and there is a lot of people there during the day. The best time to be there is very early in the morning.",
      "Very beautiful and peaceful place. They were doing construction before an event so there was scaffolding, but even that was pretty. Inside the museum is a nice gift shop and a pretty public toilet. Quick note, if you want to take a photo of the shrine, take it from the side near the gravel (or the guard will politely remind you).",
      "Very big temple with - parking, vending machines, museum, food stalls and largely many festivals and ceremonies held very frequently. One of the best places to visit and experience the difference - pleasant and lively location with lot of Ginko trees and tree shades to beat the heat while in summer, beat the cold with fantastic views in winter, thrilling views during autumn with the color changes … a place one should never miss.",
      "Founded by Emperor Meiji in June 1869 to commemorate those who died in service for Japan.\nThe shrine contains names of almost 2,5 million men including one thousand war criminals there of whom 12 were charged with class A crimes.\nBecause of this controversy the last two emperors never visited the shrine.\nThere's also a military museum adjacent to the shrine."

      "Chidorigafuchi is hands down our ultimate favorite sakura spot! 🌸💖 Nowhere else in Tokyo is more beautiful than Chidorigafuchi!\n\nAnother lucky coincidence that we came here on the last day of the sakura festival, as there weren't that many people. We planned to come here a week before, but it was raining for days. Good thing we waited for that beautiful, sunny day.\n\nDefinitely coming back here in the future.\n\nTips:\n- The best route is from the exit of Kudanshita Station.\n- There are approximately 1,000 sakura trees. According to their billboard, you can donate to the park if you want to help protect these poor trees from the effects of climate change.\n- According to the signs, you can't use tripod.\n- The line for the boat is already long when we passed by at 8am. They start operations at 9am.\n- Night lights turn on from sunset to 10pm.",
      "Although the park is located a bit far from the city center, the distance is well worth it. One of the things I appreciated most was that it wasn’t overly crowded, which made the whole experience feel more peaceful and enjoyable. Out of all the parks I visited in Tokyo, this one easily had the most stunning scenery—lush greenery, serene water views, and beautifully maintained landscapes that felt almost like stepping into a painting. The air was noticeably fresh and clean, adding to the overall sense of calm. I highly recommend trying the boating experience here—it was both relaxing and fun, offering a unique way to take in the natural beauty of the park. It’s definitely a hidden gem and a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
      "We visited during cherry blossom season, and it was absolutely beautiful. I’m not sure what it’s like the rest of the year, but our experience at that time was amazing. You can’t reserve boat tickets in advance (at least not that I saw), so it’s first come, first served. We waited in line to get a scheduled time and were lucky to get a slot just 45 minutes out—which was great! We had expected to wait much longer, possibly even needing to return in the evening.\n\nMy tip: arrive early and have a few other things planned nearby so you can adjust based on what time slot you get. Even if you don’t end up boating, the area itself is gorgeous and definitely worth a visit.",
      "Sakura Walkway by the River🌸🛶🦆\n\n• A peaceful spot for a seasonal walk during cherry blossom time!\n\n• Be sure to check the weather—sunny days enhance the atmosphere significantly.\n\n• While the overall view is pleasant, there are only a few standout spots for photos. Most sections of the path look quite similar, so don’t expect a wide variety of scenic points. Still worth a visit if you’re nearby and enjoy sakura strolls.",
      "This one is another beautiful park to visit in Tokyo to view Cherry blossom.  Visited it on 7th April afternoon. The view of Cherry blossom along the Hanzo moat was simply magical. From the park, the path leading to the Imperial Palace east garden is a nice walk and in the evenings the cherry blossom glowing in the light is another unforgettable experience. Even without cherry blossom the walk along the moat in the evening is quite nice."

The weather was great (late Oct) and although the autumn leaves weren't out yet, the trees and grass are lush and full of life. The huge koi fish swimming in the pond are also wonderful to look at. There is a bag check at the entrance.",
      "Loved visiting the Imperial Palace East Garden. It’s a vast and peaceful place, perfect for a relaxing walk. Lots of different trees, nice gardens, koi ponds, and interesting old palace structures like guard houses, cellars, watch-towers, tea house. In case u want to take a break, there are rest areas equipped with vending machines too. The entry to the garden is free! Totally worth visiting... 🍃",
      "Absolutely gorgeous garden! A lot of work has gone into preserving its historical significance and beauty, including preserving original guard barracks and the orchard. Now, the garden serves as a celebration of Japan. They’ve added various sections such as the bamboo garden with different bamboos found across the country and a tree garden with one tree from every province. The landscaping is impressive—they’ve maintained the original walls and moats—and they’ve done their best to make the gardens accessible to all ages.\n\nNo fee or ticket needed for entry, just a bag check at the entrances. Reading other reviews, it’s worth noting there is no palace here anymore, nor is the palace really visible. This is just the East Garden adjacent the current Imperial Palace.",
      "The Imperial Palace East Gardens are beautiful, even on cloudy days. I enjoyed seeing seasonal fruit trees like persimmons and citrus. The gardens are modern but designed based on the Edo-period layout on the former castle site. The guided Imperial Palace tour pairs well with a visit.",
      "Beautiful grounds - a lovely, green sanctuary within the busyness of the city. It seems very well maintained. I appreciated the informative signs, and labels for the trees. A really nice way to spend a sunny afternoon!"

      "We visited Kanazawa Station’s Tsuzumi-mon Gate just before 5pm, right as the sun was setting, and it was absolutely breathtaking. The warm evening lights illuminated the massive wooden archway, creating a dramatic contrast against the cool blue sky. In person, the scale and craftsmanship are even more impressive than any photo can capture.\n\nThe gate is shaped like traditional Japanese tsuzumi hand drums, and standing beneath it feels both grand and inviting. The beautifully lit structure draws you in, leading naturally toward the modern glass Motenashi Dome behind it. The combination of traditional design with modern architecture is truly iconic — a perfect reflection of Kanazawa’s blend of culture, history, and innovation.\n\nThe entire area is spacious, clean, and beautifully designed. We loved walking around the plaza, taking photos from different angles — from directly underneath the pillars to across the street where the whole gate comes into view. The lighting at sunset was perfect and made the reddish wood glow warmly.\n\nWhether you’re arriving, departing, or simply sightseeing, Tsuzumi-mon is a must-see landmark and one of the most memorable station entrances in Japan. A spectacular welcome to Kanazawa!",
      "The gate view is nice but the station has nothing much to offers, it's busy, there is a shopping mall next to it where youay shop some clothing a d good food. Overall, it's just a wooden gate, with blue lights shining it...",
      "It's big, it's impressive, it's symbolic. It lights up at night (looking better in blue than red, imho) and there's a fun little clock nearby.\n\nLovely little focal point that lets you know you're in Kanazawa.",

It’s not crowded and the grounds are very clean.\n\nA big bonus is that it’s right next to Kenroku-en Garden—you can walk between the two easily. The castle itself has been nicely renovated and looks fresh and well-maintained. If you’re visiting Kanazawa, it’s definitely worth a stop.",

The contrast between the white lead-tiled roofs and the massive stone walls is beautiful.\nIt is much larger than it looks, and the panoramic views of the courtyard are great for photos. It's located right next to Kenrokuen Garden, so it’s easy to visit both. Highly recommend a peaceful walk through the park!",
      "This is an interesting place to visit. Mixture of original and reconstructed buildings On a large site great to walk around and explore.\n\nImpressive rebuild of the castle buildings. The detailed craftsmanship is amazing. Other buildings are in process of being rebuild.\n\nA good 1-2 hours to get around the site. Not too busy either.  Nice park and gardens. Other attractions close by too",
      "This was a very nice and and peaceful place. The crowds were not too bad but it was a week day in autumn. The castle part was undergoing reconstruction efforts so I couldn’t explore a lot however there was still parts to explore and learn.\n\nThe gardens though were immaculate, the trees were just beautiful. There’s tons of great places for cute photos here too. There’s pods and bridges just very serene and worth the time to visit on a casual stroll.\n\nI would say if you are less interested in nature you may not enjoy this place. It’s not full of flowers or other vibrant things. Instead the architecture around the walk ways and the shape of the trees along with the ponds makes it a wonderful and relaxing place.",
      "What a lovely park, very clean and tidy. Good to have a wander round, even if you don't want to actually enter the castle itself.\nLots of toilets, as is usual for Japan. It's absolutely lovely to see public toilets, open, clean and not vandalised. If you're in the area, have a wander through the park, it's very nice."

      "Oyama Shrine is a quiet and pleasant stop in Kanazawa, best known for its unique Western-style gate, which makes it stand out from other shrines in Japan.\n\nThe shrine is connected to beautiful garden areas, and if you keep walking a little further, you can easily reach Kanazawa Castle. It works very well as a scenic shortcut or a calm route when walking toward the castle, instead of taking the main streets.\n\nThe grounds are peaceful and easy to walk through, making it a nice place to slow down for a moment while exploring the city. A great stop if you’re visiting Kenrokuen, Oyama Shrine, and Kanazawa Castle on the same route.",
      "This is an understated shrine and its compound is beautifully landscaped and ornamented. There are ample places for good photographs. Entry is free. Some donations would be appreciated.",
      "A free to visit shrine that features magnificent architecture and there is not that much people on a weekday. Worth a visit but there is no need to spend a lot of time there",
      "Decent shrine. You can walk past it to get to Osaka castle. Pretty laid back area. Not full of tourist so you can get some decent photos during the day. What I liked most is that it’s fully accessible at night as you can get some sweet photos unless you have a Nokia or are one of those cool alternative people with film. But I would still recommend it if you are one of them.",
      "This shrine has a unique western influenced architecture which is easily seen from the outside. The inside of the shrine is spacious and there's a garden and pond behind it which has really nice scenery for photos. It was drizzling when we visited and the vibes are kinda chill and calming."

      "I have mixed feelings about visiting this place. I thought the story about the nightingale floors was super interesting, and you can really hear it super well when you're walking around inside! It is lovely. But besides that, everything inside the castle really did not manage to keep my interest. Everything you see is a replica, and there are life sized dolls/mannequins all throughout the property to illustrate how people used to sit in the rooms for example. Personally i really dislike when museums use these kind of dolls, to me it's cheap and disrupts the beautiful things there are to see, but i understand why the mannequins are placed there. I understand they are there to help people visualize better. I just personally don't like it. The gardens around the castle were nice. The public restroom was dirty.",
      "Visited Nijō Castle today. It's a good culture experience to visit and look at how they constructed the building all those years ago.\n\nIt's a marvellous to see how it has held up all these years later.\n\nIt's something you need to experience when visiting Kyoto.\n\nIf you can, join a tourist guide for a little $$ extra on top of the entry fee to listen to the history, build, how each room was used, and image you being there back in the 1600.\n\nWorth doing if you want to learn about the history or just want to kill some time.",
      "I visited Nijo Castle on a weekdays therefore there were not that much crowd. It is such an interesting place to learn about the castle history. There are observation deck too where you can relax. On the day I visited Ni omaru castle was closed unfortunately. I love the architecture of the door/ gate so much. It's exquisite.",
      "Nijo Castle is a good stop if you want to see an important historical site in Kyoto. The Ninomaru Palace is the main reason to visit, especially the nightingale floors, which make sounds as you walk and are quite memorable. The rooms are well maintained, but photos are not allowed inside, so just take your time looking.\n\nI recommend buying the ticket that includes the Ninomaru Palace, the palace rooms are well preserved, but photos are not allowed inside. The garden is nice and relaxing, and it’s worth walking around slowly. There is also a former castle keep area where you can get a view of the grounds.\n\nNearby places: After visiting Nijo Castle, it’s easy to continue to Kyoto Imperial Palace, Nishiki Market for food, shopping, and cafés.",
      "A very beautiful castle, and the castle grounds, particularly the gardens, are equally impressive. Entry fee is minimal, and the castle itself was located very near to our hotel. Be ready to take a lot of pictures and a lot of walking. If you're traveling with kids, they might not be able to appreciate the whole place, and may lose interest after the first 30 minutes or so 😉. Nevertheless, this is a must visit attraction if you are in kyoto."

      "Visited Kiyomizu‑dera in March 2025.\nIn the afternoon, it was somewhat crowded, but still manageable and didn’t stop me from enjoying the visit. There’s quite a bit of walking uphill to reach the temple, passing through the charming historic streets that lead toward the complex.\nWhat really stood out to me was the iconic wooden main hall and terrace.\nThe massive wooden stage is one of Kiyomizu‑dera’s most famous features—built high above the hillside and offering sweeping views of the forest and the city below. It creates an incredible sense of openness, and stepping onto it feels like looking out over Kyoto from a natural balcony.\nBeautiful  vantage point, especially with sunlight hitting the surrounding scenery.\nThe architecture itself is impressive. The entire temple complex blends beautifully with the mountain landscape, and the buildings reflect centuries of cultural and religious history.",
      "Kiyomizu-dera is a must when you go to Kyoto. I went on an evening for one of their autumnal evening sessions. It was very stressful to deal with all the crowds so I suggest you come there either very early or late if you want to see it peacefully. The complex has lots of history and rituals (the fountains, the anchor, the fortune telling, etc.) to explore so I recommend you do it at your own pace to do everything.\n\nI think the temple looks gorgeous at night with the momiji season and this place warrants both a daytime and nighttime visit (but only if you have been here before and you have plenty of time for a second visit).",
      "Autumn at Kiyomizu-dera is absolutely stunning, and visiting during the peak maple leaf season means crowds are inevitable. Even so, the entrance ticket and the breathtaking scenery make it completely worth it.\n\nWe arrived at Kiyomizu-dera around noon on a weekday, but the number of visitors was no less than on a weekend. Sannenzaka was packed with people, so we chose a quieter side path instead. Along the way, we unexpectedly discovered a small embroidery gift shop with unique and beautifully crafted items.\n\nAs we made our way uphill, we explored several spots, drew a fortune and got daikichi (great luck), and even heard children playfully imitating crow calls, which added a lovely sense of life to the journey. The whole atmosphere felt perfect for unwinding and clearing the mind after a busy work schedule. Nice choice for annual leave.\n\nThat said, I would recommend starting earlier in the day to avoid the crowds and better enjoy the autumn leaves.",
      "Beautiful but way too crowded. Incredibly overstimulating and chaotic. There are hundreds of people. First you have to walk through a bizarrely busy street to even get to the temple. So over all its just overwhelming. The buildings are beautiful though. In this area there are also many ladies dressed up in kimono's which is cute to see. You can also collect Goshuin here in a separate room where you have to take off your shoes.",
      "My favourite sight in Kyoto. Super crowded during our visit around 12.30pm on a Sunday. This is such a gorgeous temple with beautiful grounds. Can imagine how much more gorgeous the place is in spring or earlier 2 weeks ago during the autumn changing color. Even now, it looks so gorgeous and serene especially around the pond area. It was quite a way to walk in but interesting to see all the shops around. Strongly recommend to try the mochi mochi shop along Matsubara-Dori Street. For someone who doesn’t like mochi, this was really good, haha love the chocolate flavor. Great treat and beautiful sights!"

      "I recently visited Pontocho Park, and it perfectly captures the charm of Kyoto’s traditional atmosphere. Nestled beside the Kamogawa River, it’s a peaceful spot where you can enjoy both nature and the city’s vibrant culture. The narrow streets nearby are filled with old-style restaurants and lanterns that glow beautifully at night, giving the whole area a timeless feeling. It’s a wonderful place to take a quiet walk, watch the river flow, and feel the unique rhythm of Kyoto life. Truly an underrated gem worth visiting!",
      "Lovely place to chill and watch the river. Also every evening from 4 to 9 there are local musicians playing Shamisen and other instruments. Had a great time. Will come again. And you should too. 😆",
      "Cool place to hang out. Seems very lively at all hours. Lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Lots of people walking about purposefully. Nice place to people watch and grab a meal or just stroll by the river.",

      "Our guide told us this is one of the best places to see Autumn 🍁 colours. The temple is unique for Amida Buddha statue looking back over its shoulder , unlike any other Budda statue in Japan.\nWe took off our shoes in placed them in a bag and walked around the temple to learn more about it, photography inside isn't allowed.\nThe outside garden is beautiful and filled with red and orange 🍁 leaves.\nThe highlight is a pond with the reflection of the autumn leaves and a bright red Koi fish in it.\nLoved the temple complex.",
      "Visiting Eikan-dō 永観堂 in Kyoto was a truly memorable experience. The temple grounds are spacious and beautifully arranged, and every step feels like walking into a quiet painting. The pathways, trees, moss, ponds, and traditional buildings all blend so well together that you naturally slow down and enjoy each moment.\n\nThe scenery changes beautifully with the seasons, but Eikan-dō is especially famous for its autumn colors. When the leaves turn deep red and golden orange, the entire temple looks almost unreal—like a landscape painting brought to life. Even in other seasons, the subtle greens and soft natural light give the gardens a peaceful charm.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable moments was simply standing still and looking at the reflections in the pond; the scene looks perfectly composed, as if nature and architecture were designed together from the beginning. There are many viewpoints where you feel like the scenery in front of you could be framed as art.\n\nWalking around Eikan-dō gives a calm feeling and allows you to appreciate not only the beauty of the temple itself but also the atmosphere of traditional Kyoto. It’s a place where nature, culture, and quietness all come together in a very harmonious way. I felt like I was looking at paintings everywhere I turned, and the experience stays beautifully in your memory even after leaving. 🌿✨",
      "They say this where to see the beautiful autumn foliage in Kyoto aside from Kiyomizu-dera 🙂 some other maple trees are in full bloom others are all withered. They have a special event for autumn. It’s really best to visit the temple a few hours before closing as there were fewer crowds and I’ve witnessed a monk ringing some ceremonial bells for a few minutes.\nI got to climb the pagoda too and see the beautiful golden sky of Kyoto city. I really enjoyed my stay here as I’m flying back to my country the next morning. I would love to visit again! 🌸",
      "One of my favorites temple visit because of the momiji illumination night view. I walked from Nanzenji temple for around 5 minutes or so before reavhing to Eikando temple. However had to wait for half an hour because the night illumination is only open from 5.30pm onwards, the queue was quite long since it is a famous night illumination spot. Needless to say, the view is really enchanting at night, despite being at night you can still see the vibrant colors of the leaves. Do brace the cold if you go in Dcember though. I had a great experience here and would recommend everyone to pay a visit during peak momiji season.",
      "Visiting Eikando for the night maple illumination was a unique and memorable experience. The lighting beautifully highlights the vibrant autumn leaves, giving the whole temple garden a magical atmosphere. It feels completely different from daytime viewing—warmer, deeper, and full of charm.\n\nThat said, be prepared for very heavy crowds. The paths move slowly, and it can take quite a while to get through the grounds. Still, the scenery is stunning enough to make the slow pace worth it.\nA wonderful spot for night-time autumn foliage."

      "One of my favorite Kyoto temples that I visited. A bit far from the city center but can be reached by taking the City Bus. It's on a hilly area so do expect stairs and slopes and uphill terrain. One of the most beautiful temple I went to since it is during momiji season therefore the tree leaves are colorful. One of its famous attractions and popular photo spots is the old aqueduct. If you go further up the hill you'll find a shrine at the top. I love how this temple is at the hill, therefore it's literally in the woods. It's like you're going through a wood with a temple in it.",
      "Nanzenji Temple is one of Kyoto’s most important Zen Buddhist temples, known for its peaceful atmosphere and rich historical charm. Located at the base of the Higashiyama mountains, the temple grounds are spacious and surrounded by nature, making it a perfect place to slow down and reflect. The massive Sanmon gate stands as a powerful symbol of Zen philosophy and offers a beautiful view of Kyoto from the top. One of Nanzenji’s most unique features is the brick aqueduct from the Meiji era, where traditional temple scenery blends naturally with modern history. In autumn, the temple becomes especially popular as maple leaves turn the area into shades of red and gold, while spring brings fresh greenery and quiet beauty. Walking through Nanzenji feels calm and grounding, as the sound of water, rustling leaves, and temple bells creates a timeless and soothing experience for visitors.",
      "The autumn colors at Nanzen-ji are some of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen—vivid maples everywhere, yet the atmosphere remains calm and deeply serene. The temple grounds have a quiet, timeless charm that makes you slow down without even realizing it.\n\nOne of my favorite moments was sitting along the engawa overlooking the garden as the sun set. The warm light on the trees, the soft breeze, and the peaceful silence felt incredibly relaxing and healing.\n\nIf you’re visiting Kyoto in autumn, Nanzen-ji is an absolute must. A perfect blend of nature, beauty, and Zen tranquility.",
      "A must see Kyoto attraction as a tourist. A bit far from the station, which was great for a more quiet, relaxing visiting.\n\nThere's both paid and free areas, both are beautiful. Definitely worth a visit.\n\nAlso one of the few temples where there's opportunities for tourists to take their shoes off and walk freely inside. Please be considerate of staff instructions and posted signage.",
      "Serene and peaceful, that’s why there are many visitors to this temple. It’s set right behind a mountain with gorgeous forrest. This is a must visit place when you are in Kyoto if you are looking for where locals visit. My family absolutely love the environment."

      "I skipped the arashiyama monkey park as there is already plenty monkeys where I came from (Malaysia, humans included) and I walked down the path leading all the way to this temple. Along the way you will find multiple signs which promises you a temple with great view. While the path towards the temple was pretty long, I would say it's worth it simply for how beautiful it is, I would even say the walk itself is my favourite amongst everything I have done in Arashiyama. There is also a bell where you can ring before heading up towards the temple. Once you arrived, you are required a 400 yen entrance fee. The temple itself is not grand by any means, but you do get the promised view which was quite fulfilling. Also there's was an ongoing meditation (?) class in the room so that's pretty cool.",
      "Yes it’s worth taking the path with less ppl. Worth taking that 200 steps hike up to this temple to soak in the view. Simply beautiful to soak all the nature w/o the crowds.",
      "Amazing temple away from the busy crowds 😍 you get to see beautiful river on the way to the temple too, they take cash only 400yen /person. I was there and it wasn’t that bad of a hike. Absolutely calm and peaceful 😌",
      "Lovely walk along the river,  you live all the hustle and business behind. A climb up via steps appro 1.6 k from the centre",
      "One of the most incredible adventures of my life. The walk to the climb is alongside the river. Incredible views everywhere. Decent effort required to climb but anyone can do it and should. The staff are so kind and welcoming. Ring the bell at the top and visit with the monk. The view over the top is a memory you will love forever."

      "Had lunch here on a hot day, which was both a great idea and a questionable life choice. The scenery is outstanding: emerald-green water, forested hills that look Photoshopped, and boats drifting by like Kyoto’s idea of ambient screensavers.\n\nThe downside? Shade is optional. Very optional. The sun shows up fully leveraged, no mercy, no clouds, just vibes and UV. Bring water. Bring a hat. Bring the humility to admit you are not tougher than July in Kyoto.\n\nThat said, this is an excellent place to slow down, eat something simple, and pretend you’re in a travel documentary instead of quietly sweating through your shirt. The path along the river is easy, scenic, and well maintained, and even when it’s busy, it feels calm...like everyone collectively agreed not to rush.\n\nThis isn’t a place for comfort. It’s a place for perspective. And maybe heat stroke-adjacent reflection.",
      "YOU ALL HAVE TO VISIT THIS SIDE OF THE KATSURA RIVER, A HIDDEN GEM OF ARASHIYAMA!\nNo words can describe the beauty of this place in autumn. Crystal clear water, colourful foliage, moutain, boats, rocks, everything creates an epic natural picture. Cross the bridge, walk along the river bank and enjoy the quite side of Arashiyama.",

      "Excellent place. You can enjoy a beautiful and peaceful natural landscape if you come early enough, i.e. before the crowds arrive. We visited in the early morning on 23 November 2025.",
      "Nice if you can manage to find the trails and go deeper into the park. Very close to The Bamboo forests but close to the Arashiyama shopping areas and tourist hot spots. Row boats are available to rent to go up and down river. Very beautiful scenery and worth a visit. No cost to walk around the park areas and nice for a quiet getaway day hike."

You'll need to walk through arashimaya bamboo trail then up a steep trail in the hills before you see 3 view points. Come wearing comfortable shoes to walk a trail.",

Near the river\n\nI got there from the Arashyma bamboo groove by walking through the Kameyama-Koen area of Arashiyama Park. The deck is located on a hill overlooking the Hozu River and is easily accessible from the northern end of the bamboo grove.",

Unfortunately, I was wrong to hope that the whole (or at least 50%) of the mountains are in lush red, orange or green.\nMainly, the colours are dispersed quite sparsely. But hey! Don't let me take away from your experience!\nStill definitely worth the visit !",
      "Stunning panorama and breathtaking views of mountain and valley, blanketed in the foliage of autumn. Just takes few minutes walking from arashiyama bamboo forest.",
      "A really beautiful part of the world. The short trek to the viewpoint past the bamboo forest is breathtaking (and free!). When you hit the T-junction in the bamboo forest, go left and then head uphill to the observation point. Next view point about 50m to the right is also nice. Then take the long walk along the river back to the town area. The view of the river and gorge alone is well worth the visit."

      "Tenryu-ji Temple in Arashiyama felt like stepping into a perfectly painted landscape. The whole place is incredibly calm, with a beautiful pond right at the center that reflects the trees and mountains like a mirror. The garden is stunning and so well maintained that every corner looks deliberate, almost like it was arranged for visitors to slow down and breathe for a moment. It is peaceful, scenic, and genuinely one of those temples where you can just sit for a while and feel your mind settle.",
      "I visited Tenryuji temple while visiting Arashiyama. It is famous for its garden. During momiji peak season the garden is very beautiful with tress with different colored leaves, sadly I went when the peak season is ending therefore a lot of leaves already fallen. If you buy ticket for temple entrance and garden together you can get a cheaper price. The trail was easy there was no steep slopes or many stairs so very friendly towards people with knees issue. From the garden also you can get a glimpse of the famous Arashiyama bamboo forest.",
      "Very nice and grand temple for sure.  It has many from small, medium, and large individual sections of house that next to each other.  And at the middle, there is a garden (which you have to purchase tix to entrance). Each house has it own garden and the design and the decor are different from one to another.  Very intriguing and inspiring, you can cell the calmest one you enter the temple.   Very unique and one of a kind for sure.  The garden is big and pretty and very picturesque.",
      "Visiting Tenryu-ji 天龍寺 in Kyoto was a truly enjoyable experience. The temple grounds feel peaceful from the moment you enter, and the beautiful garden surrounding the main hall is one of the highlights. The combination of traditional architecture, quiet pathways, and carefully arranged nature creates a relaxing atmosphere that invites you to slow down and appreciate the view.\n\nThe famous garden is especially impressive with its large pond, elegant rocks, and the beautiful arrangement of trees. No matter which season you visit—whether it’s fresh greenery, colorful autumn leaves, or gentle winter scenery—the landscape has its own charm. The way the garden blends naturally with the mountains behind it makes the view look almost like a living painting.\n\nWalking through Tenryu-ji gives a calm feeling and offers a wonderful way to enjoy both nature and traditional temple culture in Kyoto. It’s a lovely place to take photos, enjoy the scenery, and spend a quiet moment away from the busy city. I found the experience very memorable and would definitely recommend it. 🌿✨",
      "Tenryu-ji (Arashiyama): Arashiyama’s Zen garden gem—its pond uses “borrowed scenery” to frame Arashiyama’s mountains (pure landscape magic).\n\n• Seasonal highlights: Fall = maple hues + mountain reflections; Spring = cherry blossoms dusting the garden.\n\nPro Tips:\n\n• Walk 5 mins to Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (perfect combo route).\n\n• Arrive "

      "Enjoyed this more than the bamboo forest as the crowds were more spread out. Beautiful to visit in fall. Could have spent more time exploring the different paths, but had to leave to catch a boat ride. Toilets were also clean",
      "22nd November 2025\nPart 3 of my Arashiyama Trip review.\nAcross the bridge, I arrived at the ABSOLUTELY STUNNING VIEW of Kameyama Park.\nThe colours....the Red, Orange, Yellow, each with different hues, along with thr ever-present lush greens. These combo, complemented with the vast infinite blue sky, was jaw-dropping.\nAs you can see from my photos, it still does not do justice to the real life scenery.\nMy eyes are forever spoiled by this trip. It will never see colour again and I am ever more grateful to be blessed with sight",
      "Beautiful scenery. Arashiyama park is a great place to take photos. The restaurants and stores near make this park even better if you want to spend the day near it too. The best part is that all of this is free!\n\nSummary 📝:\n- beautiful scenery 🏞️\n- near restaurants and stores 🛍️\n- despite being near a river, there are very\nlittle bugs 🐜\n\nI'm not a good photographer, so you could probably get much better photos than the ones below!",
      "Right next to the bamboo forest and it’s far less crowded. There are beautiful riverside views, and even more beautiful views of the gorge from the top of the hill. Well worth the climb, even though it’s not the most fun in the middle of summer.",
      "Kyoto's Park Kameyama Area is a lovely spot for a relaxed break from the city's crowds. Tucked away within the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, it's easy to miss, but worth seeking out. The park is a peaceful, hilly area with a few scenic viewpoints that offer great photo opportunities of the river and the surrounding mountains. It's a nice place to sit on a bench, enjoy the quiet, and watch the small boats drift by. While it doesn't have the grand, iconic feel of some of Kyoto's more famous sites, its charm lies in its simplicity and tranquility. It's the perfect place to catch your breath and enjoy a moment of nature before heading back into the bustling streets."

      "Nishiki Market is a lively, sensory-rich place that captures the everyday food culture of Kyoto in a very direct way. Walking through the long, narrow arcade, you’re surrounded by stalls selling everything from fresh seafood and pickles to sweets, skewers, and traditional snacks. The atmosphere feels busy but engaging, with many vendors preparing food right in front of you, which makes browsing as enjoyable as eating. It’s an easy place to sample a wide variety of local flavors in a short amount of time.\n\nThat said, the market can feel crowded, especially during peak hours, and it’s more suited to slow wandering than quick shopping. Prices at some stalls may seem higher than outside markets, but the convenience and variety partly explain that. Overall, Nishiki Market offers a vivid snapshot of Kyoto’s culinary traditions and is well worth a visit for anyone interested in Japanese food and street-level local culture.",
      "A total tourist trap but one you have to experience at least once. The street is narrow, the crowds are relentless, and the atmosphere is loud. Come for the chaos. Stay for the spectacle: a maze of tightly packed vendors offering everything from fresh seafood and skewered mystery snacks to delicate sweets, fragrant teas, and unique souvenirs.\n\nThe energy here is infectious, the grazing is fun, and pushing through the crowds feels like stepping straight into Kyoto’s food culture. The food varies widely in quality. There are some truly delicious finds, but many offerings are just okay and often come with a hefty price tag. Still, that’s part of the charm, sampling unfamiliar treats, watching skilled vendors at work, and soaking up the vibrant chaos.\n\nTake your time wandering, try a few intriguing snacks, and enjoy the spectacle. If you want a more substantial or reliably high-quality meal, though, you’ll be better off heading to one of the nearby restaurants just outside the market.",
      "Wonderful 1st day in Japan & Kyoto to explore all the delish foods available.  The place is about half a mile long or abit more and every inches of the place filled with different type of foods which make it harder to figure out which one to try 1st.  We ended up tasting 30% of everything that offered.  Glad that we ate and walked and ate and walked some more.  Definitely a great place to check out for sure.  All stalls and restaurants are great with customer service, and it makes it harder to leave.  Love it and will come back for more next time.",
      "This is the spiritual home of Kyoto snacking: five blocks of culinary temptation wrapped in a roof that looks like a technicolor spreadsheet. If you come here hungry, congratulations: you’re the target demographic. If you come here not hungry, don’t worry...give it ten minutes and the smell of grilled seafood, sesame, and pickled… everything… will break you down like a private-equity acquisition.\n\nYes, there’s genuinely great food here. Fresh seafood, sesame-crusted everything, teas, sweets, things on sticks you couldn’t identify under oath...it’s all part of the charm. The vibe is electric, chaotic, and very much a people-watching goldmine.\n\nBut let’s not kid ourselves: this place is also touristy as hell. For every stall selling authentic Kyoto flavors, there’s another quietly upselling you into a ¥700 “local experience” that may or may not be microwaved. It’s the classic trap...you know it, they know it, and we all just smile and play our part.\n\nStill, the energy is great, the snacks are fun, and weaving through the crowd feels like stepping into Kyoto’s bloodstream. Come for the food, stay for the vibe, accept that you’ll overpay for at least one thing and pretend it was worth it for the cultural enrichment.\n\nFour stars. A must-visit...just keep one hand on your wallet and the other on the nearest skewer.",
      "This was fun! It wasn’t very crowded around 10:30am on a Tuesday and all of the shops were open. We were able to stop for food at different stalls and walk the entire market in about an hour and a half and as we were leaving around noon it was getting very crowded so definitely come early"

      "It was such a fun experience! Took less than an hour. We made the appointment a month in advanced. We chose the option to select your style once you got there. They allow you to try on samples and pick what size, design, and finish (matte vs shiny). They also offered the simple engraving for free! We don’t speak any Japanese and were able to communicate well. Highly recommend for the memories.",

      "This is a must‑visit spot in the Kansai area. We’d been meaning to visit the museum for over a year, and we were lucky to get tickets. The museum was fairly busy, so expect some waits for the popular games. The Hanafuda workshop was a fantastic family experience—our kids learned a lot about Hanafuda history and the seasons, and it made a great keepsake to display after the trip. Don’t forget to look for all the Pikmin. The staff are very helpful, and the entire venue is incredibly detailed.",
      "We managed to get a 2-2:30pm entrance slot on a Thursday! Entrance was easy. They have storage lockers where you deposit a ¥100 coin to get a key and then you scan your QR code for entrance. There are some spots for photos and there are staff at each spot to take your picture for you.\n\nThe shop had everything we wanted in stock other than one shirt in XL. Some items are limited to 2 per customer, like the blind box keychains of the console sounds and the mini consoles.\n\nThe exhibit on the second floor was extensive and we loved seeing the history of Nintendo and all of the games from our childhood. There was a really cool display on the wall that showed the evolution of some of the games from console to console. Pictures were not allowed on the 2nd floor.\n\nThe first floor interactive exhibit was really cool. Each activity you pick will take pictures and automatically upload them to your ticket page. The lines seemed long but moved quickly because each activity was pretty short.\n\nWe would definitely want to come again and spend more time exploring the exhibit!",
      "A must visit place for Nintendo fans and gamer in general.  The exhibition floor itself is enough to pay a visit, experience the 40 years of nintendo history, a chance of glancing through game design and development, our beloved character iteration by iteration before the final version that we knew of.  Comsoles of good old days.  What a feeling.  The day we went was quite crowded, 3pm entry, so we do not have enough time to play all the games on the 1st floor, but that's totally ok.  Morning entry is way better with crowd.  Merch is all great for fans.  Highly recommended.",
      "You know when you signed up for when you come to this place. If childhood and nostalgia is a place, it's this museum. This place is separated into 2 levels. The first level displays all the consoles Nintendo ever created, as well as the game. It is displayed in a circle which makes it very nice to walk and enjoy your favourite console's history and games. The bottom floor is more interactive and has N74. super Nintendo which you can play using the card you're given. There are also other games where you use giant controller or your body to play. Those have a longer queue then the normal console games.\nI think the only downside is the booking of tickets. It is a pain to book and sells out fast, so do try your luck before your trip as I managed to get tickets just 1 week before my trip.\nOh and photography is not allowed at the top floor where the displays are.",
      "​As a lifelong Nintendo fan, visiting the Nintendo Museum was nothing short of a dream come true—it’s a true pilgrimage site.\n​Entry & Booking:\nThe process is a bit of a challenge as you need to enter a lottery on their official website months in advance to secure tickets. It’s a bit troublesome, but let me tell you, it is absolutely worth the effort!\n​Museum Layout:\nThe facility is well-organized and divided into three main areas: the Outdoor Photo Spots, the Restaurant, and the Main Building. Inside the Main Building, you’ll find the 2nd-floor Exhibition Hall, the 1st-floor Interactive Play Area, the Shop, and the Workshop.\n​The Experience:\n​Exhibition Hall (2F): This was the highlight for me. It’s organized by different consoles and timelines, showcasing an incredible volume of rare collectibles and historical items. Even as a long-time fan, I was completely blown away by the depth of the collection. Seeing the evolution of my favorite series was a truly emotional experience; it brought back so many precious memories of playing these games over the years.\n​Interactive Area (1F): The interactive exhibits are incredibly creative, blending classic Nintendo charm with modern technology. I highly recommend visiting with friends, as many of the games are designed for two players and are a blast to play together.\n​Service:\nThe staff members are exceptionally helpful. Their English is more than sufficient for basic communication, so international visitors don't need to worry at all.\n​Time Spent:\nIf you’re a true fan, you could easily spend an entire day here. I entered in the afternoon and stayed until they closed, and I still felt like I could have stayed longer!\n​Final Verdict: Don't hesitate—if you get the chance to win the ticket lottery, just go. It's a beautiful tribute to the history of gaming."

      "📍 Chureito Pagoda 新倉山浅間公園 忠霊塔\n@ Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 🇯🇵\n\nWe visited Chureito Pagoda on 18 November 2025, one of the most iconic Fuji-view spots in Japan. Located within Arakurayama Sengen Park, the pagoda is part of the Chureito Memorial Tower (忠霊塔) built to honor the war victims of Fujiyoshida City.\n\nThe climb up the long staircase takes some effort, but the reward at the top is incredible. The viewing platform offers the classic postcard scene — the red five-storied pagoda⛩️, the city below, and Mount Fuji 🗻 standing beautifully in the background. During our visit, the area was decorated with red maple trees 🍁, adding even more colour and depth to the scenery.\n\nThe park is well maintained with clean paths, and the fresh mountain air makes the walk enjoyable. The autumn colours around the pagoda created a warm and vibrant atmosphere, making this viewpoint even more memorable.\n\nA must-visit landmark with stunning Fuji views, vibrant red maple trees, and the classic pagoda silhouette — absolutely worth the climb. 🗻⛩️🍁✨",
      "We began our journey by taking the train from Kawaguchiko Station and alighted at Gekkouji Station. From there, it was about a 15 to 20-minute walk to the base of the hill leading up to the pagoda.\n\nAs we approached, we began our climb up the staircases. Along the way, we paused to admire and photograph the vibrant autumn leaves, which painted the trail in brilliant shades of red and gold.\n\nEventually, we reached the Chureito Pagoda. Although it was a cloudy day and Mount Fuji remained hidden, the experience was still breathtaking and serene.",
      "I hate being around other tourists, but this was very much worth the hype. Soak in the whole experience, not just the basic photo op at the top. The crowds were slightly bothersome but manageable in the fall. Lots of stairs so prepare to be winded. So worth it though. You actually start seeing crazy views of Fuji on the stairs if you pause and turn around on your way up. The fall colors were absolutely stunning. Highly recommend watching sunset here. We stayed much longer than we initially allotted because we just couldn't stop looking at Fuji's majestic form. It got pretty cold once the sun set which was to be expected. The pagoda is beautiful but the massive uninterrupted scale of Fuji taking up the whole horizon was really the best part. There are staggered steps in front of the pagoda to mitigate the crowds but there are other winding paths on the sides that were totally empty. When we arrived at first it looked like there was a line (?) but only for the area right in front of the pagoda. It kinda dispersed 30 minutes before sunset.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best viewpoint we went to. If you don't have much time in Fuji, skip the cable car and just do this.\n\nAfter dark, the stairs are not lit at all so be careful of that. With nightfall the crowds dropped significantly and yet there were some small groups starting their ascent as we were leaving.\n\nPhotos from late November.",
      "I had a good time regardless if I didn't get to see mt. fuji because of one cloud that didn't want to leave. Yes you should plan ahead and look at the weather for the day but we just went out on a limb and decided to go for it. Again overall we still had fun. We took a bus all the way there and a bus back. We didn't book any tour group. You can also take the train there but being able to book a bus and get assigned seats was better. Didn't have to worry about getting a seat. Be prepared to walk or climb a bunch of steps. Definitely got a leg workout that day. There are to paths, stairs and a slow gradual incline road to get up to the Pagoda. The stairs are more direct but more exhausting. Was still a beautiful sight to see.",
      "We visited this place during the second week of October 2025. We had booked a Mount Fuji tour on Klook, the guide took us to Oshino Hakkai, Lawson station, Lake Kawaguchigo and this pagoda was our last stop near this area. Our guide said that it would take just 30 minutes to go upstairs for a healthy person. I managed to climb the first 50 steps but my leg started giving up. I even felt nauseous and sat in between for a while. Then I had a sudden rush of adrenaline and started analysing why am I here at Japan if I can’t even climb 500 stairs to goto a viewpoint. Then I slowly started again and took break between every 15/20 steps. My husband whom I had asked to go earlier had already reached the top and made a new friend from Mexico and was talking to him. He was delighted to see that I made it, I was over the moon because I never gave up. The view of Mount Fuji was incredible. On our way back we shared a lot of stories with the Mexican friend. Overall a wholesome experience."

      "Visiting Hakone Jinjya Heiwa-no-Torii on a weekday was one of the most peaceful experiences of my trip. There was no wait to enter, and the quiet setting made it easy to take in the beauty without distraction. The iconic red torii gate rising from the lake felt timeless — a perfect blend of nature and tradition. The surrounding trees, soft breeze, and gentle ripples on the water created a calm that stayed with me long after I left. It’s not just a photo spot; it’s a place to pause and reflect. I didn’t need to buy tickets in advance, and everything felt accessible and welcoming.\n\nThe walk to the gate was smooth, and the area was well-maintained without being overly commercial. I appreciated how the site allowed for personal space and quiet moments, even with other visitors nearby. If you’re looking for a spiritual or scenic stop in Hakone, this is one of the most grounding places to visit. It’s ideal for solo travelers, couples, or anyone wanting to slow down and connect with the landscape. I’d recommend going early in the day to catch the soft light and avoid any weekend crowds.",
      "📍 Hakone Jinjya Heiwa-no-Torii\n箱根神社 平和の鳥居 @ Hakone, Japan 🇯🇵\n\nA beautiful lakeside torii and one of Hakone’s most popular power spots. The red torii standing on the water creates a peaceful, spiritual atmosphere with stunning lake views. It’s also a very popular photo spot, so expect some queueing.

      "Torii Peace is a Japanese-inspired restaurant that typically focuses on providing a blend of traditional and modern dishes. It often stands out for its calm, serene atmosphere, reflecting the peacefulness and aesthetic of a traditional Japanese torii gate, which symbolizes transition or a gateway to a sacred space.\n\nHere’s a general review breakdown based on the elements people commonly look for in such a restaurant:\n\n1.

Overall Experience\n•\tCustomers often describe dining at Torii Peace as a holistic experience, where the flavors, the environment, and the service work together to create a peaceful and enjoyable outing. Whether it’s a casual lunch or a special dinner, it’s the kind of place where you go to unwind and savor the moment."

      "Came at 1030 during Christmas, was first in line. However, a line was forming rapidly to about 5-6 party by the time it was time to open. There's two line, one to dine in and one to takeout, the friendly staff ushered and reordered the queue that I had formed previously 15 mins before 11. Restaurant seats 10, about 3 party per wave. Food came around 1115, and we were the first to be served.\n\nWhile the restaurant is renowned for its beef sandwich, I personally preferred the Egg sandwich. It was outrageously oversized, creamy, fluffy, the bread toasted with butter, it also contained flavourful egg white (sunny side up style) to break the monotony, good job! The beef sandwich comes in 200/400g, and it's always comes in 2 separate sandwiches regardless of the meat portion size. The beef slices were aromatic, seasoned very well with pepper, my eyes were opened. However the beef was chewy, hence I preferred the Egg mayo. I also tried the chicken nanban sandwich and enjoyed the tomato, mayo, and lettuce.\n\nWhen we left around 1140, there's about 4 other party waiting outside. I'll come back to takeout the egg sandwich :-)",
      "Absolutely incredible. Best sandwich I’ve ever had! I got there early so there wasn’t much of a wait. The place does takeaway as well as dine in. I’m 100% certain that any sandwich you choose is going to taste amazing. They are known for their egg sandoichi which was obviously oishii and I also had the steak. But my favourite was the ham and cheese! I don’t think you will find any better. Meccha Oishii!!",
      "Shop opens at 11 but we already lined up (dine-in line) at around 10:30 to be the 3rd customers to get in. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The place is very small (I think they can only have ~10 people dining in inside) that the take-out line was also a good option for some who didn't mind eating elsewhere.\n\nTo be honest, I think people come here for the steak sandwich but the highlight for us was the tamago sandwich!! The bread was very soft and tasty that I kept talking about it after. The steak was a bit chewy and the but was still tasty nonetheless. The chicken with egg was also good but I'd really keep going back for the tamago sandwich :)",
      "Didn't know about the instagram fame of this place just saw the line up and decided to check it out the next day. Came early to try and beat the line but still had to wait over an hour. Especially for dine in, there is limited space inside so be prepared for hour long wait, much quicker to do take away.\n\nHad the egg salad, steak and potato sandwiches.\n\nEgg salad was okay, they had a large piece of cooked egg white meringue around the outside to keep the egg salad from spilling out which was salty. From the color of the egg salad I was expecting something more but the bright orange color is them spreading egg yolk on the cut. The egg salad on the inside is nice and creamy but no different from any conbini eggsalad.\n\nSteak sandwich was really strangely sweet and was the only sandwich we didn't finish. The meat was certainly rare in parts and well cooked in others but all of the pieces were extremely chewy. It's a very chewy almost dessert like sandwich.\n\nPotato salad was nice, creamy, good mayo but that's all it is. They also sprinkled the top with black pepper which I like in my potato salad but having it as a topping just made me sneeze and lead to bites with too much pepper.\n\nAll of this pales in comparison to the state of their kitchen, it looks like they never clean the kitchen area, pans looked crusty and the walls near the stove was covered in old burnt grease and they were storing the fried sandwich fillings like the chicken right next to it. I have been nothing but surprised at how clean all the restaurants and shops have been in japan and this was a disgusting slap in the face.\n\nThe one thing this shop excels at is clearly marketing but has no substance to back it up. I hope tourists see this review and decide to spend their money at many of the other shops around that serve quality food for cheaper and from cleaner kitchens.",
      "I was very disappointed by all the hype and the TikTok and Instagram posts. We ordered the egg sandwich, the small steak sandwich, and the Namba chicken sando. The only one that was okay was the egg sando. The Namba chicken sando was cold and just average. The steak sando was the worst—the beef didn’t taste like beef at all and was extremely chewy. It also had an unpleasant seasoned flavor that ruined it.\n\nI really don’t understand the hype. In my opinion, it wasn’t good at all.\n\nThank goodness we didn’t have to wait long since we went early. By the time we left, there was a long line, and I honestly felt bad for those people."

      "Their Basque Brûlée Cheesecake is to die for!! Super soft & smooth texture on the inner portion of the cake, and more dense towards the edges, beautiful gastronomical experience lol! With that richness, I had to get an americano. Even their coffee tasted interesting! Bitter with a little bit of acidity.\n\nThe space is intimate & they have outdoor seating. They play jazz music inside, free WiFi, toilet, and quick service! No card & cash only. Would come back to try their other coffees & espressos!",
      "We had a late dessert here as we wanted to try the brulee cheesecake. We just shared one and my friend ordered an americano.\n\nThey said to order one drink per person but I already said my friend ordered one and I'm ordering a cheesecake slice.\n\nThe place is cozy but quite cramped. It has a very chill vibe and has outdoor seating too.\n\nThe brulee cheesecake was creamy and not too sweet. It's best partnered with black coffee or plain tea, not the sweet coffee drinks.",
      "Cois Espresso Club Shinjuku Gyoemmae has moved from its original location, which is a bit of a shame because I actually preferred the old spot. It was smaller but had that cozy, slightly crowded charm that made it special. The new place still has a nice vibe though. The cheesecake is delicious, and when it comes to coffee, I think the fancy or signature drinks stand out more than the basic ones. Overall, still a lovely café worth visiting if you are in the area.",
      "The best expresso experience we’ve had in Tokyo thus far. The crème brûlée cheesecake was phenomenal. Worth the wait. The ladies inside were very polite and helped with seating.",
      "Wow! That was such an amazing coffee experience\nI’m always looking for fusion in restaurants, something new and exciting, and I finally found it here\nEach coffee flavor is extraordinary, I took the other day the tiramisu espresso which was FANTASTIC and the brûlée espress and cheesecake where sooo good\nToday I took the Rocher, the chocolate berry and the cheese and each one was outstanding!\nThe service was amazing and they even got us the brûlée cheesecake on the house!\nWe will take something to go and definitely come back tomorrow"

      "The gardens were beautiful the time we went in November. All the autumn colours were just so vibrant it felt kind of like a little movie 🎥\n\nThere's so much diversity in everything that's on offer the gardens from simple plans and trees to water fixtures and architecture. It's a very warm and welcoming place very cheap to get into to as welll.\n\nI proposed to my partner now at this garden and I couldn't think of a better spot within Tokyo 🗼",
      "Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden is a stunning and serene oasis in the heart of Tokyo. The beautifully landscaped gardens combine traditional Japanese, English, and French styles, offering a peaceful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle. Walking through the winding paths, I was captivated by the perfectly maintained lawns, seasonal flowers, and tranquil ponds. The cherry blossoms were particularly breathtaking, creating a magical atmosphere that made my visit truly unforgettable. It’s an ideal place to relax, take photos, and enjoy nature, all while feeling completely immersed in a calm and refreshing environment.",
      "I visited late July 2025. Even though it was one of the pricier parks I visited in Japan at 500 yen, I went to Shinjuku Gyoen twice and absolutely loved it. The park is very large, so you can easily spend a long time walking around and exploring the many ponds. You can also go inside the Taiwan Pavilion and learn about its history. I really loved the nature and the beautifully designed landscape, with scenic paths and bridges crossing the ponds. Along the way, you can see turtles, birds, and fish. There is also an area with many rosebushes. The park has toilet facilities and cafés, which makes it comfortable to spend several hours there.",
      "This place is absolutely stunning in autumn. initially set aside 1 hour to visit the garden but ended up spending close to 3 hours here. Park opens at 9am (in Nov) so don’t go too early. also recommend to watch the historical video on how the garden started to appreciate it better - 10/10 would recommend to take a breather from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. come early as it tends to get crowded around noon.",
      "A beautiful and peaceful escape in the middle of Tokyo. Shinjuku Gyoen is incredibly clean, spacious, and well-maintained. The park has lovely Japanese gardens, open lawns, and a stunning greenhouse. Perfect for relaxing walks, picnics, and photography.\nI went during ___ (spring/autumn/etc.), and the scenery was breathtaking — especially the cherry blossoms!\nVery easy to access from Shinjuku-Gyoenmae Station. Highly recommended if you want to enjoy nature in the city."

      "Absolutely the most scenic bike ride I have ever done. Even though it’s not the cherry blossom or snow-capped season, the view of Fuji mountain is quite spectacular from every angle along this lake.",
      "One of the most serene lakes i have ever seen in my life. I visited in autumn and the weather was slightly cold but very lovely.\n\nIt is about an hour and 30 minutes drive from tokyo\n\nOn a clear day you can get scenic shots of mount Fuji\n\nThe lake is next to oishi park which I also recommend visiting, there you will find souvenir shops and cafes",

The area is quiet yet charming, with cozy cafés, small shops, and scenic spots that invite you to slow down and enjoy the moment.\n\nLake Kawaguchiko is more than just a sightseeing spot; it’s a place to unwind, reconnect with nature, and appreciate the simple beauty of Japan. A truly memorable destination that leaves you feeling peaceful and inspired. 🌸🗻",
      "Lake Kawaguchi is a stunning, natural lake surrounded by mountains and hills. The water was very pristine. There is a track and road around the entire lake which you can use for walking. It is also popular for people to hire bicycles to ride around. I found the area to be calming. Mt Fuji can also be viewed from here if weather conditions are good."

      "We bought 2 little cakes (rose and mont blanc) and 1 pumpkin tarte. They were delicious! I would have liked more of a rose flavor but it was good. It's also an awesome crochet design and the texture is fun. I would recommend going out of the way to try these.\n\nI only speak English but I do know please and thank you in Japanese and that was enough to get by and I was treated normally.  They asked how long our travel was to get to where we can eat them and based on that they will put ice pack(s) in the packaging. As long as you are prepared to take them to go and eat somewhere else it is great. It was a 20-25 min commute back to our hotel and it worked out great.",
      "This desserts are amazing. They are perfect, not too sweet and all the ingredients mix perfectly without covering the other flavours. I’m not a big fun of super sugary food, so this was really good. We will definitely come back to try more 😍",
      "This place is so cute!  The pumpkin pillow was tasty and everyone enjoyed a treat. Downside is no seating but this place is elegant and feels fancy.",
      "We came because the cakes looked adorable and perfect for photos. We were not expecting them to taste as delicious as they did. Both cakes we got were the right amount of sweet, with complex flavors, and the perfect size for one person. They were so flavorful and I can’t wait to go back and try other flavors!",
      "It's a take away place in a quiet neighborhood of Osaka. Cakes and the ambience is quite aesthetic. The staff is polite and helpful. We were here to try their Instagram famous crochet cake. They change the flavours ever so often so we ended up picking the pumpkin flavoured cake and to our surprise it tasted amazing. We went here late in the evening but we're lucky enough to get our hands on it. After speaking to the staff we realised the best time to visit is earlier in the morning as the best ones get sold out fast and there is a big rush in the later hours."

Must do for sure. Watch for the bus schedule so you come out on time. The bus runs every 55 min after 4 pm.",
      "This was my first time experiencing a beautiful outdoor onsen with an amazing view right in front — a large waterfall.\n\nOn the left side, there’s also a swimming pool.\n\nThe pool and onsen were both great, and there weren’t many people either. When we visited, it was just the two of us in both the onsen and the pool.\n\nThe place is really beautiful. You can check in for an overnight stay, or if you just want to access the onsen and pool, that’s also possible. The rental swimwear is already included in the fee.",
      "The hotel is unavailable so this is only talking about the baths. There are two types of baths: the single private bath that is in the cave along the stairs down to the waterfall, and the public bathing area that is next to Oh-daru (the waterfall).\n\nThe one private bath is in a cave and you actually have to walk past the entrance to get to the service desk. There is a locked door and it must be reserved, you get the key which must be returned in 30 minutes. There is no shower or toilet in the cave. There is no locker or changing area either but that's fine since the door is locked. The cave is actually quite dark which gives it a certain atmosphere. Recommended for couples.\n\nThe public bathing area is quite large and begins at the base of the waterfall and extends along the river. There are 6-7 baths of varying size and temperature, some of them outdoors, a single shower, a swimming pool, and small sheds used for changing. Because the area is public and outdoors, swimsuits are required. There are coin lockers at the entrance.\n\nThe price is 1000 yen per adult. Towels and swimsuits are not provided but available for rent for a fee. Notably, slippers are not available at all given the size of the public bathing area. Overall the public baths are quite scenic and outdoors mixed baths are extremely rare now so it's a great opportunity if you're a family and the private bath is unique and interesting, but the facilities are old and there are almost no amenities provided! Shower beforehand and bring your own swimsuits, towels, and pool slippers.",

      "We went there by april 29 for there \"hotspring day only\" . We didnt book rooms for the hotel of amagiso. Amagiso is famous for there open air public bath.\n\nThe price is very cheap including the perfect view of the falls and the nature while bathing on their hotspring.\n\n✅You must wear a swimsuit or diving suit.\n\n✅Tattoos are allowed as long as it's not that visible. You can just cover them with your long swimsuit\n\n✅there's a large pool but open only during summer season\n\n✅You need to walk down maybe about 10-15mins to reach the reception center. (It's just a small house)\n\n✅do not bring too much stuff because they don't have that enough space or room.\n\n✅They have comfort room.\n\nTake note :\n\nThey do not have washing area to cleanse your body after bathing. So you do not need to bring any shampoo or soap. It is just literally like dip then get out."

      "We came here on a day trip booked via Klook. The village itself is peaceful, with houses built along the seaside. It’s nice to walk around and very quiet. You rarely see locals — most of the people around were tourists like us, wandering through the area. It feels like a wonderful place to live",
      "\"Ine Fishing Village is a breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful place. I had a truly relaxing time admiring the crystal-clear water and the serene blue sky—everything felt so calm. The only lively spot is near the pier where you can take a boat tour and feed the seagulls. The seagulls are quite bold and their beaks are a bit sharp, so be careful, but it's a fun experience! The traditional wooden houses (Funaya) lining the waterfront create a unique and stunning view. This is the perfect sanctuary if you're looking for tranquility. Highly recommended!\"",
      "Ine is a charming and picturesque town that offers a refreshing contrast to the bustling energy of major cities like Osaka and Kyoto. One of the most appealing aspects of Ine is how peaceful and quiet it feels, making it an ideal destination for travellers who want to slow down and enjoy a more relaxed pace. The town has a calm, laid-back atmosphere that allows visitors to truly appreciate its natural beauty and traditional surroundings without the crowds commonly found in larger tourist hubs.\n\nAs you explore Ine, you will find a small but pleasant selection of restaurants and cafés scattered around the town. These spots provide comfortable places to rest, enjoy a meal, or simply sit back with a drink while taking in the scenic views. While the dining options are not extensive, they are sufficient and add to the overall charm of the town rather than overwhelming it. The focus here is clearly on quality and atmosphere rather than variety.\n\nBeyond dining, Ine is best enjoyed as a place to wander leisurely. The town is known for its beautiful waterfront scenery, traditional boathouses, and tranquil streets, making it perfect for walking and photography. One of the highlights of a visit is taking a boat tour, which offers a unique perspective of the town from the water and allows you to fully appreciate its distinctive character. Overall, Ine is a lovely destination for a peaceful day trip, ideal for those seeking quiet beauty rather than busy attractions.",
      "Highly recommend visiting Ine Fishing Village. This style of fishing village is unique to Japan with the houses right on the water. If arriving via vehicle. There's a parking lot across from the Ine Junior high school \"Inechugakko Inenomori Parking Lot\", recommended to park there. It's free and only about 50 meters down to the water's edge. There's alot of traffic and if there's no parking available at the shoreline, you'll need to follow the lines of cars to the next lot. So best to park there, and beat the traffic.\n\nFrom the viewpoint at the water's edge, there's a tourist information center across the street beside the paid parking lot.",
      "Walking around Ine Fishing Village 伊根の舟屋 and visiting the Funaya no Sato Observation 舟屋群展望所 was a very nice experience. The viewpoint gives a wonderful scene of the blue bay, and the traditional boat houses lined up along the water look very charming. It’s amazing to see how the funaya houses are built right at the edge of the sea, showing a traditional lifestyle that is unique to Ine.\n\nThe contrast of the calm blue water and the wooden houses creates a beautiful and peaceful atmosphere. From the observation deck, the view feels like a postcard, and you can really appreciate the history and quiet charm of the village.\n\nIt’s a great place to take photos, enjoy the sea breeze, and simply relax while looking at the scenery. The walk through Ine and the viewpoint together make a memorable experience and a lovely moment by the sea. 🌿🌊✨"

      "Kegon Waterfall, located in the scenic town of Nikko in Tochigi Prefecture, is one of Japan’s most famous natural attractions and is often regarded as one of the country’s top three waterfalls. Standing at an impressive height of about 97 meters, the waterfall is created by the outflow of Lake Chuzenji, which sits high in the mountains of the Nikko National Park. The water cascades dramatically down a towering cliff face, creating a powerful mist that fills the air and adds to its majestic atmosphere.\nVisitors can enjoy two main viewpoints. The free upper observation deck provides a broad, panoramic view of the waterfall surrounded by lush greenery in summer and vibrant foliage in autumn. For a closer and more immersive experience, a paid elevator takes you down to the lower viewing platform, where the thunderous roar, cool mist, and sheer scale of the falls can truly be felt.\nKegon Waterfall changes dramatically with the seasons. Autumn brings brilliant reds and golds, winter transforms the falls into frozen pillars of ice, and spring offers a refreshing, clear display. Whether you're into photography, nature, or just sightseeing, Kegon Waterfall is a must-visit destination that captures the raw beauty of Japan’s landscapes.",
      "Kegon Falls is an incredibly calming place—its powerful waterfall is truly mesmerizing. You can enjoy the view from the top, but if you’d like to experience it from below, there’s an elevator that takes you down about 100 floors (with a small ticket fee). The view from the bottom is absolutely beautiful.\n\nThere are a few eateries around Kegon Falls where you can grab a bite. About 200 meters away is Lake Chuzenji, where you can enjoy swan boating or take a lake cruise. The scenery around the lake is stunning and definitely worth visiting.",
      "One of the most beautiful waterfalls I’ve ever visited and probably the most beautiful I’ve seen in Japan. I arrived in early November, a bit too late for the fall colors but still wondrous nonetheless. It’s relatively easy to access great viewing points and worth the effort to see if you’re in the area. Definitely check it out when in Nikko!",
      "The scenery was stunning. I visited at the end of October, traveling by rented car. The autumn leaves were changing color, which was absolutely beautiful. To view the falls, you must purchase a ticket before descending by elevator. The Kegon waterfall vista from the base is simply superb. They also have a souvenir shop there. Be aware that these falls are located in the mountains, quite a distance from the Shinkyō Bridge, so you should plan your time carefully to arrive before sunset. 🍁🍂🍃",
      "Enjoyed the bus ride to Kegon Waterfalls.  The falls were impressive and was worth paying the small fee to travel down the lift to get a different view of the falls.  We walked through the small town for a bite to eat, checked out the pretty lake.  Its a good half day visit or you can explore further."

This ryokan possesses an unparalleled charm that distinguishes it from any other lodging.\n​The awe-inspiring beauty of the surroundings, the meticulous attention to detail, and the serene, timeless atmosphere along the River truly define this place.\n​If my travels ever bring me back to Kyoto, there is no doubt that I will choose to stay here again.

It’s a true gateway from all the city buzz — surrounded by a peaceful bamboo forest and overlooking the river.\n\nWhat I loved:\n•\tThe service was exceptional — thoughtful, polite, and always delivered with a warm smile.\n•\tThe location and setting are absolutely magical, tucked away in nature yet close to Arashiyama.\n•\tThe 5-step facial skincare routine provided in the room was such a beautiful touch — relaxing and luxurious.\n•\tThe morning stretch session was refreshing and set the tone for the day perfectly.\n•\tThe panoramic view from our Tsukihashi Maisonette room was breathtaking.\n•\tThe room design itself was stunning — antique Japanese style with authentic details and modern comfort, spread across two floors.\n\nWhat could be improved:\n•\tThe first floor includes a tatami room and bathroom. The tatami room had a very strong smell that I personally found uncomfortable, but the housekeeping staff were kind enough to spray and light incense to help.\n•\tThe narrow stairs connecting the two floors can feel a bit inconvenient, especially when you need to go downstairs to use the bathroom at night. It would be great if the tatami room were replaced with an additional bedroom, as it would make the maisonette perfect for families or groups.\n•\tThere’s no direct access to the rooms; guests must take the hotel’s boat each time to go in or out. While the boat ride is beautiful and unique, it can feel restrictive if you’re staying for several nights.\n\nOverall, it’s a beautiful, serene, and luxurious escape — perfect for one or two nights of tranquility. But for longer stays, the limited access and room layout might feel a bit less convenient. Still, an unforgettable Kyoto experience.",
      "This is an outrageously beautiful and remote property. You take (book) a boat to get to and from the hotel, but they can pick you up in a car if it's after hours. This place leaves you feeling completely transported, and the staff are so attentive and gracious. Wonderful on site restaurant and a host of activities that you can book in advance, some free (i.e. morning stretch/riutal), others require payment (we did Matcha tea making on a boat ride that was so serene). Cannot recommend this hotel enough... it's on the pricier side, but worth it. Thank you Hoshinoya Kyoto team for such a memorable stay!",
      "The views at HOSHINOYA Kyoto were spectacular. I stayed here for a nice relaxing end to my trip in Japan and it really delivered on that. The boat to/from the hotel was fun. However, for the cost you pay to stay there, I felt it was pretty lacking overall.\n\nTHE ROOM:\nThe bed was not comfortable at all. It had a super hard mattress and two terrible pillows that could combine to make a somewhat OK one. Views from the bedroom were really nice though - you could see the river and it was very peaceful.\n\nOther than that, there wasn't a ton there. It was a pretty standard room with a nice (albeit dark) bathroom.\n\nAMENITIES:\nThere wasn't a ton here. I ended up spending quite a bit of time in the lounge because there wasn't much else to do if you were at the hotel itself.\n\nIn the lounge area, they had a few seats outside that overlooked the river. It was great for bird watching. The general refreshments were OK - drinks were hot tea, cold brewed green tea, a Nespresso machine and rice crackers.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\nBreakfast is served in your room and is a hot pot with some side dishes. It overall tasted nice.\n\nDinner is served in a separate building and typically goes for 2 hours (it did really drag on at the end each night). The food was overall quite nice - there are a good variety of dishes which was fun. I have a dairy allergy, and they were great at making swaps that didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.\n\nI give it a 3.5.",
      "This was the hotel I was most looking forward to staying on my trip to Japan. Unfortunately it was very underwhelming and for the price, I would not stay here again. Like others have mentioned, the rooms are dark and even though they face the river, our room is obstructed by the window trimmings. I think tje interiors could definitely use a refresh. In addition, there was a mildewy smell in our hallway and room that was unpleasant. The dinner on site was not very good and I didn’t eat most of the courses. The highs were the service - everyone was very friendly and helpful - and the morning stretching class."

      "Oide Park is a peaceful and picturesque park that offers one of the most beautiful views in Hakuba. With a charming bridge, flowing river, and the Japanese Alps in the background, the scenery feels timeless and postcard-perfect.\n\nThe park is quiet and relaxing, ideal for a gentle walk, photography, or simply enjoying nature. Each season brings a different kind of beauty, from fresh greenery to snowy mountain views.\n\nOide Park is a wonderful place to slow down and appreciate Hakuba’s natural charm. Simple, serene, and truly memorable. 🌿🏔️",
      "Such a peaceful spot surrounded by nature — perfect for a relaxing evening walk. The view of the mountains and river is beautiful, especially during sunset. A great place to unwind and enjoy the calm side of Hakuba.",
      "The river along the park 🌿🏞️ is absolutely breathtaking with the scenery behind! 💙\nThere’s also a hidden spot if you walk a bit up the hill.\n\nThe only downside — parking’s a bit small.",
      "Relaxing in summer!\n\nCome early, when i arrive at 7 am, no one here! So i enjoy my calm, relax and good vibes!\n\nPlease go up! Just 2 minutes walking and you will see a good view! Mix of snow mountain, river and green tree!!",

      "Such a cool step back in time! The historical reenactments and period costumes really brought everything to life. There are so many buildings to explore and well laid out schedules.

I do wish we had gotten there earlier—we ended up missing a few of the reenactments.",

      "My friends and I attended the first,  because of the brave  5k today. What a beautifully campus with over 20 structures a pond a bridge and so much history.  The buildings are so beautiful and the grounds are kept up to perfection. What an important part of history.",
      "Really fun and educational place with lots of things to do. Everyone was very nice. Went for fourth of July and got to watch a reenactment.",
      "This is a cool place. They have several buildings that are replicas of the real buildings with exhibits in some of them. They have a new exhibit which I think requires an age limit as it's had a lot of audio-visual talking aspects and children under 12 are going to get bored very easy as a lot of them did on the tour, I was part of it, and it was hard to hear the lady who was leading the tour. But I do recommend seeing the exhibit and the buildings its pretty cool. They are adding to the area Im not sure what they are adding as I didnt ask as I didnt know who to ask. There are bathrooms in several areas on the property and parking."

      "Hideo Goto, the owner of Takamine Onsen waved us off as we departed, his love for the environment, the hot spring, his drive to educate his guests and in fact his attitude to life is inspiring. After a gas fire in 1975, he gradually rebuilt the lodge without electricity, water and with the restriction of only being able to work in the summer months. He rebuilt it strong, with triple glazed windows and wood in preference to concrete. Accommodation is traditional, with futon and cushions on tatami, there are no chairs, beds or TVs in the rooms. There are many communal areas with seating though and Goto happily shares his knowledge,  delivering daily talks about the birds, the stars and the health benefits of the spring water. The highlight of course is the open air bath admist the Takamine alps. The Japanese do not hesitate to get totally naked on mountain tops in minus degree temperatures and why not, the experience is exhilarating: excruciatingly freezing, to exquisitely warm and then  breathtakingly visual. The outdoor bath is open to guests between 7am and 5pm. The correct protocol is to collect a basket in the open air bath waiting area. Red for ladies and blue for men, the baths are segregated, if there are no baskets - wait. After leaving the waiting area, there are outdoor slippers to change into. Wet your body by pouring a bucket of water, scooped from the bath before entering. At least look like you are having a quick wash before entering. The lady in the bath asked if she could talk to me. It was her third visit to the hot spring, mine too, there are a lot of repeat visitors. Takamine Onsen is one 150 hot springs that have been selected as members of the preservation of hot springs society, and there is stamp booklet to try and collect ten stamps within three years, to earn a free stay from any of the 150 hot springs, none of which will disappoint.\nMy previous visit to Takamine Onsen was in autumn, the highlight of that visit was joining the 4-hour guided tour to Ikenodaira Wetlands, a pond within a volcanic crater. There are many well marked trails from the lodge, gum boots and snow shoes are provided and the ski slopes are within easy reach.\n\nEven if venturing outside is too daunting, there are four indoor baths, two each for men and women, which are brimming with magnesium, calcium and natrium/sodium.  Goto-san encourages guests to drink the spring-water which is purported to cure constipation, skin conditions and diabetes. The bird watching area is a great spot to learn the names of the Alpine birds and wildlife.",
      "I only went to use the bath. It is small but it's one of the best ones I've been to. Perfect temperature and between baths you can rest with a cold drinks in a seating area where they have a squirrel feeder right outside the window. Or you can chill in front of the fireplace.",
      "【雲に隠れた絶景、心に残る灯り】\n\nAt 2000 meters above sea level, Takamine Onsen Lamp no Yado feels like a hidden retreat floating in the clouds. Even on a gray, misty weekend, the place was full—proof that it has earned its reputation.\n\nThe common spaces carry a rustic, outdoorsy charm, while the guest rooms feel fresh and well maintained, clearly renewed in recent years. The onsen was the star: silky, milky-white water with that unmistakable mineral scent, hot enough to soothe yet cool enough to linger. Although the clouds kept the mountain panorama hidden, you could sense how spectacular the view would be on a clear day.\n\nDinner was homely and satisfying, the highlight a pork-and-apple miso grill prepared right at the table—sweet, savory, and deeply comforting. When stargazing was rained out, the owner hosted a cozy slideshow of the surrounding seasons, a gesture that made the evening feel intimate and personal.\n\nIf there was a flaw, it was in sleep: the futons were so thin that comfort was elusive. Breakfast, too, was on the plain side. Yet with its genuine hospitality, healing baths, and the promise of unforgettable vistas, I left already wanting to return—this time to see the stars and walk the trails.\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\n【Features】\n♨️ Onsen: Milky-white water, outdoor and indoor baths, excellent quality\n🛏️ Room: Clean, well-maintained, renewed in recent years\n🛌 Sleep: Futons thin and less comfortable\n🍽️ Dining: Dinner highlight—pork with sliced apples in miso, cooked at the table\n🥢 Breakfast: Simple, somewhat plain\n🙋‍♂️ Staff: Warm, thoughtful, photo slideshow when stargazing was canceled\n🌄 View: Hidden by clouds, but stunning on a clear day\n🎐 Ambience: Outdoorsy common areas, cozy atmosphere\n🏔️ Location: 2000 meters elevation, ideal for hiking (weather permitting)\n🔙 Would I visit again? 💓Definitely",
      "This simple mountain lodge stands on the Takamine Plateau at an altitude of 2000m. Hot spring lovers will love the open-air bath, which is synonymous with the lodge, where you can enjoy the milky white hot spring water and the dynamic mountain scenery. They also hold events where you can get in touch with nature, such as trekking for beginners and stargazing events.",
      "The room price might seem high, but staying in this hotel is totally worth it! I enjoyed staying at the outside onsen, the inside one (there is a small and a big one inside) were also nice to relax. It was really nice to talk to everyone while having a bath. The price also included dinner and breakfast. The highlight was the view from outside onsen and the star watching after dinner! We did not have enough time to book a trekking tour or to go hiking, but I saw that you can rent a lot of equipment for free! The staff did not speak English, so communication was a little complicated, bit worked out in the end. The hotel is very close to a ski place, which is why some routes were blocked and we had troubles finding the hotel. Gladly we stopped at a different hotel, they helped to call and we were kindly picked up from the hotel bus. I highly recommend taking a room with mountain view, it was stunning to wake up here!"

      "Just a stunning place we spent a wonderful day in Shirakawa-go and were lucky enough to have a warm-ish, sunny winter day, which made the experience even better. Some of us walked up to the observation area, but there’s also a shuttle you can take for just a few yen (cash only), which is a great option especially with the icy conditions.\nThere was quite a bit of black ice around and it was slippery in places, so sensible footwear is definitely recommended (though we did see some very brave souls in heeled boots!). The views are stunning and the houses look straight out of a fairytale absolutely beautiful and very photogenic.\n\nWe had a few travel options and chose to take the bus from Kanazawa there and back. For us, this was by far the easiest option comfortable, straightforward, and cost-effective compared to piecing together trains, buses, and walking.\n\nThe bus takes you straight into the village and back again, and at around $50–$60 return, it was well worth it in our opinion.\n\nWe found a small local spot serving udon soup, which was delicious and incredible value. We also visited the onsen, and it was completely empty either our timing was perfect or we were just very lucky, but it made for such a peaceful experience but they only take cash.\n\nOne tip: bring cash. Not all ATMs accept foreign cards, and one we tried wasn’t working, so we had to walk to the post office ATM instead. Overall, a magical place and well worth the visit.\n\nSecond tip: if travelling by bus then yes beat to book tickets (even a few days) in advance.",

      "Shirakawago was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for our family. We were incredibly lucky to witness snowfall on December 4th, turning the entire village into a real-life winter fairy tale. The traditional gassho-zukuri houses covered in fresh snow were absolutely breathtaking.\n\nVisiting with my wife and kids made the moment even more special. The atmosphere felt peaceful, magical, and unforgettable—especially since this was a rare early snowfall. A perfect mix of winter charm, culture, and family memories that we will cherish forever. Highly recommended, especially if you’re lucky enough to catch it during snowfall.",
      "This is definitely a must-visit destination in the Gifu Prefecture of Japan.\n\nWe stayed at ANA Crown Plaza, Kanazawa, which was located about 3-min walk to the bus station where we waited for a coach to send us to Shiragawa-go. Thank goodness we booked our tickets prior as the coach was already full. We wanted to go a day later but there wasn’t any seats available.\n\nIt was barely an hour coach ride, the scenic journey was easy & pleasant. There were a lot of tourists from all over the world. We were immediately reminded to stay at the same place for our pick up coach upon reaching. Not necessary to buy any more entry tickets…we gotten an English map & walked along the paths, just looking out for oncoming villages’ cars or goods trucks.\n\nSorry for I have not posted my review much earlier. So these pictures were taken before the snow hit the area, we preferred the super cool season, but we wanted to still see every detail of the heritage houses & compound!\n\nIt was a beautiful, clean & well kept area. The old houses were well maintained. We loved how they were weaved & heaped together with wooded planks/straws & many other materials. Amazingly they could withstand the changing but drastic weathers. There were a few eateries, cafes, a supermarket & some souvenir shops. We bought a few boxes of chocolates & cheese cakes. Wind was pretty strong snd by the end of our walk, the drizzle was already making us feeling so cold. Heat packs were pasted all around our pockets to keep us warm. Umbrellas were needed. The drop off & pick up holding area was rather small & crowded with people waiting for coaches. As it was cold outside, many tourists rushed here to take shelter from the drizzle first. It was so so packed! Do check the weather forecasts before visiting this place.\n\nI would highly recommend that you stroll up the little hill on the higher ground to take a bird’s eye view of the village. It was breathtakingly beautiful. There were cyclists riding uphill, what a daunting task to me. We were already panting halfway up!\n\nIt took us about 3 hours plus to complete our stroll around the entire compound. We had 50min spare time before our coach arrived. We walked to the other end where a small cafe stood quietly. The old couple were veteran owners of good coffee brewers. They served aromatic hot coffee, hot chocolate drinks & good cakes too. Again, definitely worth a visit to Shiragawa-go.",
      "A beautiful and well kept village. Really let you have great experience how local stayed in the past. There is some snowfall a few days earlier so we still get to see some snow here and there although is melting. A beautiful and stunning location with a proper huge parking location design for tourist. In the village, it is not allow to drive unless you are folks that stayed or work there. A nice walk along the village with many small shops along the street selling souvenirs and small eats. We also climb up the slope to the mountain to have even better view of the village. Note that this is a highly touristy location and during peak time, it is really full of many buses of tourist dropped here in the morning. A day trip is sufficient imho. unless you want to experience the ryokan stay there."

      "Shinsekai is a very lively and crowded area with a fun and energetic atmosphere. The streets are always busy, full of people, lights, signs, and shops. Walking around Shinsekai feels exciting, especially at night, because there is always something happening and many places to look at.\n\nThere are many small game shops and attractions in this area. Visitors can try different games and enjoy the playful environment. However, most of the games are shooting-style games, such as shooting guns or archery. At first, they look fun and easy, but after playing, many people feel that the games are designed to make players lose.\n\nSome games use tricks or unfair rules, making it very hard to win prizes. Because of this, visitors often spend more money without getting good results. This can be disappointing, especially for tourists who are not familiar with these types of games.\n\nOverall, Shinsekai is a fun and colorful place to visit and walk around. It is great for experiencing a lively local atmosphere. However, when playing games, visitors should be careful and not expect to win easily, as many games focus more on earning money than fair play.",
      "STEP INTO A TIME MACHINE SET TO 'RETRO-FUTURISTIC OSAKA'\n\n·\n\nVIBE CHECK\nthis neighborhood is a vibrant, slightly chaotic love letter to a bygone era. it feels like a carnival frozen in the best way, with colorful signage, old-school game halls, and the iconic tsutenkaku tower watching over it all. the energy is nostalgic and genuinely fun.\n\nTHE BACKSTORY\nshinsekai, meaning \"new world,\" was built in 1912 to showcase a futuristic vision. today, it stands as a wonderfully preserved old part of osaka city, a historic entertainment district that offers a raw, authentic slice of osaka's past.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\ncome here to wander, eat legendary kushikatsu, and soak up a uniquely osaka atmosphere. it's less polished and more real, offering a delightful contrast to the city's modern hubs. a must-visit for culture and vibe enthusiasts.\n\n·\n\npeep the images for your ref; they’re worth a thou.\n\nmake sure to ❤️!",
      "Cool retro futuristic place with the iconic Tsutenkaku tower. Recommended to visit both in the day and night as the vibe of the place feels entirely different.\n\nThe area is relatively small, and filled with food and game stalls, most of them serving the local specialty- kushikatsu. Really love some of the 3D designs of the shop lots too.\n\nDefinitely a must visit here in Osaka.",
      "Shinsekai feels like stepping into Osaka’s retro past in the coolest way. It’s colorful, slightly chaotic, and full of personality. You’ll find bright neon signs, giant puffer fish lanterns, old-school arcades, and plenty of places to eat. It’s a fun area to just walk around, grab some snacks, take photos, and soak up that nostalgic “old Osaka” vibe.\n\nIt can get touristy and crowded at times, but that lively atmosphere is part of what makes it memorable.",
      "Absolutely loved exploring the streets around Shinkesai and Tsutenkaku Tower. This area has such a unique Osaka energy — vibrant, a bit nostalgic, and full of charm. Wandering through the narrow streets, neon signs, old-school eateries, and quirky shops felt like stepping into a different era of the city.\nThe atmosphere is lively but authentic, not overly touristy, which made the experience even more special.\nDefinitely a must-visit when in Osaka if you want something real, fun, and full of character. I’d go back in a heartbeat!"

      "This place gave my family one of our best food experiences in Japan – and at an unbelievably cheap price, if you know the trick!\n\nWe arrived around 11am and the market was already packed with people. We were told they close around 1pm, so it was getting close to the end of the day. Instead of buying straight away, we decided to walk around first to check the prices and compare the different stalls. It’s very tempting to buy from the fancy-looking shops, but I’m so glad we explored a bit more.\n\nThat’s when we found a small, simple stall run by an elderly man. No fancy sushi displays, no stylish plating – just honest, fresh tuna belly sashimi being cut right in front of us. The portions were incredibly generous, and the price was literally half of what the more commercial stalls were charging. He didn’t even have tables; it felt like he mainly sells to locals.\n\nEven though he couldn’t really speak English, he was very friendly and tried his best to accommodate us. We ended up standing next to his fridge eating fresh tuna sashimi until we were completely full. It was such an authentic and memorable experience.\n\nWe’ve been to several markets around Japan, but this was by far our best discovery. Amazing food, great value, and a truly local vibe. If you visit, take the time to explore – you might just find the same hidden gem we did!\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who loves fresh sashimi and real local experiences.",
      "Such a fun place to eat, shop, and explore! There’s an amazing variety of food, from fresh seafood like melt-in-your-mouth tuna, sushi, oysters, and grilled scallops, to sweet treats like the popular egg desserts that are totally worth the wait. The market is lively, colorful, and full of energy, making it a great spot for photos as well. While prices have gone up and some shops feel more geared toward tourists, most of the food is still delicious. Shops do close early, so it’s best to come in the morning, but even visiting in the afternoon can be rewarding with some great discounts. Overall, it’s a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy fresh food and soak in the vibrant market atmosphere.",
      "If you’re a food lover, this iconic Tokyo destination belongs at the top of your travel list. Tsukiji Outer Market is a vibrant, bustling food paradise that delivers an unforgettable culinary experience for everyone — from seasoned sushi aficionados to casual explorers.  ￼\n\nFrom the moment you step into the maze of narrow streets lined with stalls and restaurants, you’ll feel the energy and colour of one of Japan’s most legendary food districts. There’s a reason people call it Japan’s Food Town — the mix of fresh seafood, local snacks, kitchen shops, and traditional eats is nothing short of spectacular.  ￼\n\nFresh, Affordable Seafood & Sushi\nThe seafood here is as fresh as it gets — most of it delivered daily from the renowned Toyosu Market — and that freshness shines in every bite, especially the sushi and sashimi. Whether you’re grabbing a classic nigiri plate, a giant kaisendon (seafood rice bowl), or sampling oysters and grilled tuna skewers, the quality is consistently excellent and often surprisingly affordable for Tokyo standards.  ￼\n\nSomething for Everyone\nIt’s not just seafood — while fresh fish and sushi are major highlights, you’ll also find a dazzling variety of street food and snacks. From fluffy tamagoyaki (Japanese sweet omelette) and grilled seafood to hearty miso soups and sweet pastries, the market offers mouthwatering options at every turn.  ￼\n\nLively Atmosphere & Local Culture\nPart of what makes Tsukiji so special is the atmosphere — a lively blend of locals and travellers exploring, chatting with vendors, picking up kitchen tools, knives, and other unique Japanese goods, and enjoying food on the spot. Go early in the morning to experience it at its best and beat the crowds before noon.  ￼\n\nPerfect for All Types of Visitors\nWhether you’re a sushi purist, a curious traveller, or visiting with family, there’s something here for everyone. It’s educational, adventurous, delicious — and one of the best ways to dive into Tokyo’s food culture.",
      "Tsukiji Outer Market is an exciting place to explore, where simply wandering around is enjoyable and every bite is tasty and filling. It’s highly recommended to walk through the market and sample some of the local favorites, especially the fresh sushi and incredible wagyu beef. The area is full of excellent dining options, though it does get very crowded and prices can be a bit high. Keep in mind you’ll need cash and there’s an ATM available inside the market. If you’re visiting Japan, this spot is definitely worth a stop for an unforgettable food experience.",
      "A food lover’s paradise! Tsukiji Outer Market is an absolute gem and one of the highlights of any trip to Tokyo. Even though the wholesale market moved to Toyosu, the outer market is still thriving with the same energy, incredible freshness, and unbeatable seafood.\n\nThe food here is simply amazing—some of the best I’ve ever had. From silky, melt-in-your-mouth otoro sushi and perfectly creamy uni to grilled scallops dripping with butter, fresh sashimi bowls bursting with flavor, and sweet tamagoyaki egg omelets, every bite is pure perfection. Everything tastes like it was caught that morning, and the variety of street stalls and small restaurants means you can hop from one delicious spot to the next.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively, authentic, and full of friendly vendors happy to share their craft. Come hungry, wander the alleys, and treat yourself to breakfast or lunch here—you won’t regret it. A true Tokyo must-do!"

      "Visited Kanazawa & stayed at ANA Crowne Plaza for 3D2N. This hotel was so near to the bus station, train station & all malls & food eateries! So travelling around Kanazawa was made easy by getting a map as well as a transport day pass per person. The tourist info centre here rendered all the assistance we needed, so try to get everything there. We followed the map & their recommendations.\n\nWe arrived by their route bus to Higashi Chaya district. No queue. No entrance fees. Not too crowded as it was a pretty, nicely spread out district. However, it would be very much nicer if you could visit it in the late afternoon to night as the lightings were more beautiful.\n\nPleasant slow walk, for about an hour & a half. There were tourists getting snacks & ice cream in different parts of the districts. Small cafes & eateries spread around here. We were not hungry after our heavy breakfast so we were gamed for a walk only. It was rows & rows of old houses, still liveable & well maintained. Fresh air & clean environment. Saw a wedding possession  in a Japanese shrine I would deem it special. Quite a private one & a priest was holding the ceremony for the couple.\n\nAt all the bus-stops, the directional signs were clear. Route buses always had passengers we could ask for help, but we usually looked at maps, listened to the announcements made in buses, or followed the crowds to alight. Besides, there were plenty of taxis around too. No one could get lost here.\n\nDo visit if you have the time.",
      "Higashi Chaya District (ひがし茶屋街) is a beautiful and atmospheric place to visit in Kanazawa. The preserved wooden teahouses and traditional streets really make you feel like you’ve stepped back into old Japan. It’s especially lovely in the morning or late afternoon when it’s less crowded and the light is perfect for photos.\n\nThere are many small cafes, souvenir shops, gold-leaf desserts, and traditional sweets to try. Even just walking around and soaking in the calm, historic vibe is worth it. It’s clean, well maintained, and very walkable.\n\nHighly recommended if you enjoy history, culture, photography, or just a relaxing stroll in a traditional setting.",
      "The main street is a bit touristy but the neighbourhood is quite lovely and colourful, I much preferred coming here than to Nagamachi Samurai District. You’ll see many people wearing kimono (mostly for picture taking), and it’s quite fun. Many shops and cafés, and there’s one place that offers workshops about gold leafing but you have to book that in advance.\nA visit here, with stops to take some pictures, will take 20-30 minutes if you don’t stop to eat/drink.\nNot much to see if you’re walking from the castle or train station on your way, though.",
      "A trip to the Higashi Chaya District in Kanazawa is one of those things that you just have to do, and for multiple reasons. Go for the history. If you aren't into history, go for the sights. If sights aren't your thing, go for the food and drink. If that's not your cup of tea either , why are you traveling? Just kidding. Just make the time to visit the area. It's beautiful here, especially in the spring. It can get crowded so come early or late if you aren't into mingling with others.",
      "The Higashi Chaya District in Kanazawa, Japan, is well preserved historical geisha quarter with traditional wooden short buildings, lattice windows and front door, and long cobbled streets, offering a glimpse into Edo-period entertainment atmosphere, now filling with modern cafes, craft and souvenir shops, dining restaurants, and traditional Japanese teahouses, making it an experience to visit in the cultural attractions.\n\nMy family of four visited to watch geiko and listening the traditional music in the evenings.\n\nWe were walking along the main cobbled streets and quieter back alleys, exploring the Japanese crafts made beautifully displayed in the shops."

      "Amazing market, large but feels small in a good way. Easy to wander and don’t forget some restaurants on basement and second floor.  Was busy at noon in November with fellow tourists, but plenty of locals as well.  The fresh seafood and produce (catering to locals) was wonderful.  Tried some fresh cut fruit, coffee, and the most amazing pumpkin croquettes.  You’ll never waste your time on a pumpkin latte again.  So much better than Kyoto market.",
      "Omicho Market is the heart of Kanazawa's food scene and a must-visit for its incredible energy and variety. The covered streets are lined with stalls selling everything from freshly caught crab and sea urchin to grilled seafood skewers and local croquettes.\nWhile it’s famous for Kaisen-don (seafood bowls) and sushi, don’t miss the chance to try \"walking foods\" like grilled oysters or even gold leaf ice cream. It gets very busy around lunch, so arriving in the morning is highly recommended for a more relaxed stroll and the best selection of goods.",
      "🦀 Omicho Market – Kanazawa\n\nOmicho Market is a true celebration of product excellence. This is not a place where food is dressed up to impress, it’s where quality speaks for itself. Impeccably fresh seafood, seasonal specialties, and a deep respect for provenance define every stall.\n\nEach counter feels like a masterclass in precision: clean cuts, pure flavors, and ingredients at their absolute peak. Walking through Omicho is to understand why Kanazawa holds such a strong reputation for seafood and culinary culture.\n\nTake your time, observe, taste, and enjoy. This is high gastronomy in its most honest and authentic form.\n🐟🍣✨🍶",
      "Mixed feelings about this market.\nPositives: -multiple options for fresh fish and other seafood\n-covered roof which protects you from the sun/heat\n-multiple food vendors have seating to enjoy your food sitting down\n-culture\n\nNegatives:\n-there is a strong odor in the air due to the market being covered with a roof causing lack of ventilation. It is definitely not horrible, I don't want to make it a bigger deal than it is, but if you have a sensitive nose then just keep this in mind\n-barely any vegetarian options to find\n-crowded\n-public toilet has a window that has direct view to outside (if someone stand near the window they can fully see you!)",
      "Personally I love this market much better than the fish market in Tokyo and Kyoto.\nBased on language spoken, it seems to be locals are dominant crowds here.\nI had a wonderful meal inside the market.\nSo happy that I came all the way here from Nagano for a day trip🙏🏻❤️🤗"

      "Kenrokuen Garden is truly spectacular, with an extraordinary level of attention to detail. It might sound cliché, but seeing workers in full wet gear standing in the ponds, carefully scrubbing stones by hand, really highlights just how meticulously the gardens are maintained. The dedication is impressive.\n\nBeyond the craftsmanship, the setting itself is breathtaking. Snow-capped mountains frame the lush green gardens, creating a contrast that feels almost unreal. Coming from Australia, where trees are often removed if they appear even slightly dangerous or out of place, the difference in philosophy is striking. In Japan, branches are supported rather than cut away, allowing trees to grow into these beautifully balanced, sculptural forms and the results are stunning.\n\nThe garden invites a gentle, leisurely walk, giving you time to truly take everything in. It’s a peaceful, inspiring experience and absolutely well worth the visit.",
      "Kenrokuen Garden is absolutely beautiful and truly feels like a work of art. Every section of the garden is carefully designed, with ponds, bridges, trees, and open spaces that come together in a very harmonious way.\n\nI visited in December, and even without cherry blossoms or autumn leaves, the garden was still stunning. The winter atmosphere gave it a calm, elegant feeling, perfect for a peaceful walk.\n\nA very helpful detail is that visitors aged 65 and over can enter for free, which is great to know when visiting with family. The garden is well maintained and easy to navigate, with many scenic spots that invite you to slow down and enjoy the surroundings.\n\nDefinitely a must-visit if you’re in Kanazawa and appreciate traditional Japanese gardens and artful landscapes.",
      "One of the most beautiful Japanese gardens. Scenery is amazing, in the morning is relatively quiet. Visited during December and even though it’s probably not so bloomed like during the summer it’s still beautiful. You can easily hang out there 2-3h just absorbing nature",
      "Fantastic! The entry fee is 320 yen (so cheap) and it will buy you access to a beautiful peaceful garden. It’s evident that a lot of people work here. The park is in excellent condition and really taken care of.\n\nThe pond, buildings, bridges and trees (pines) are just breathtaking, especially on a sunny day.\n\nThere are bathrooms all over the park and it’s possible to buy drinks in some places. Easy to walk but there are some stairs.",
      "Beautiful garden, unfortunately we did not have much time to calmly walk around the gardens due tot us being in a travel group so we had to follow a schedule. It was also quite hot, so I did not really enjoy being here so hastily. If i had more calm time i would enjoy the garden more. It was interesting to see how the weight of the branches were supported by woodens beams. There were multiple bodies of water and lots of different types of trees and plants."

      "Kenninji Temple offers a refined and contemplative experience that feels true to Kyoto’s spiritual core. As the city’s oldest Zen temple, it balances historical depth with an understated elegance that never feels performative. I am particularly impressed by the dragon ceiling in the Dharma Hall — powerful yet restrained, it commands attention without overwhelming the space. The rock gardens and surrounding halls encourage unhurried reflection, making the visit feel genuinely restorative rather than touristic. In my opinion, Kenninji rewards those who slow down and observe closely, offering quiet depth rather than dramatic spectacle.",
      "Had the good fortune of stopping here at 1630 on a weekday in November.  Streets in area were a mad house, but very few people on grounds and inside.  Walking around the free outside area just ok. Well worth the small entry fee.  Not a huge space but the zen garden was great (noting very few people on my visit and that will make a difference).  Dragons design on ceiling was amazing and most people entered with a gasp.  Limited photos, no flash, no video.  No shoes once inside.",
      "Beautiful. The ticket price is a bit stiff comparing to other temples in Japan, however, this temple deserves it. I can spend hours to soak my soul in the calmness of these gardens. There are certain rules that you have follow here to keep the quiet & enjoyable moments with other guests.",
      "We didn’t plan to visit here. We passed through it. On the way back to the hotel. Slightly tired. Mentally full. Expecting a shortcut, not an experience.\n\nAnd that’s kind of the magic.\n\nIt doesn’t shout for attention. It doesn’t sell enlightenment in gift-shop form. It just… exists. Massive wooden halls, restrained geometry, raked gravel, pines standing around like they’ve been practicing patience for 800 years. The scale is impressive, but the vibe is calm, not “look at me.” Power without flexing...very Kyoto.\n\nWalking through it felt like your brain being gently told, “Hey, maybe stop running background apps.” No crowds, no chaos...just space, shadow, and the quiet confidence of Japan’s oldest Zen temple doing its thing since 1202.\n\nThis is the kind of place you don’t rush toward...you drift into. Perfect for a reset, a breather, or that late-afternoon moment when your feet are tired but your curiosity isn’t. You leave lighter, calmer, and mildly suspicious that Zen monks might have figured out something important.\n\nTip: Go late afternoon. Fewer people, better light, and the kind of silence that feels intentional.",

The moment you sit down, they waddle over without hesitation—tiny bodies, warm and solid, piling onto your lap and legs like living cushions. Before you know it, you’re completely “trapped,” but in the best possible way.\nEach piglet has its own personality. Some burrow in and fall asleep instantly, others climb over their siblings with surprising determination, and a few pause just long enough to sniff before settling down. Their weight is comforting, their warmth calming, and the soft sounds they make—gentle snorts and tiny breaths—create an oddly soothing atmosphere. Time seems to slow as they curl up together, turning you into part of their nap pile.\nWhat makes the experience special is how natural it feels. There’s no rush, no chaos—just a quiet, wholesome moment of connection. You don’t need to do anything except sit still and enjoy being chosen as the preferred resting spot.\nIt’s oddly therapeutic, grounding, and genuinely joyful. You leave with a lighter heart, a big smile, and the unmistakable feeling that you’ve just experienced something simple, pure, and unforgettable. Being crushed by piglets is happiness in its softest form. 🐷💚",
      "With many animal cafes in Japan, we decide on visiting a pig cafe because we are really curious about how the interaction with pigs is like since it is not easy to get a chance to get up close to pet pigs.\n\nThe experience proves to be eye-opening, where I realise that pigs are so cute and smart.\n\nFirst thing first, the pigs are actually pretty clean, with the older ones potty trained, and there is no strong smell at the place. Of course, there is a slight smell of animals, but I can still manage it. So I, being a clean freak, can actually feel quite okay at here.\n\nOne thing to note is that the pigs love to flock to warm laps and just rest or sleep there. So when we go into the cute enclosure and then sit down, and voila, pigs all rush to sleep on our laps, with some squeezing in between their friends to get a warm spot. Yes, I have about seven pigs on my lap and I see some falling asleep right on my lap!\n\nIt feels pretty heartwarming to have the pigs coming over like that. Though need to note is that we are one of the first few patrons to go in at the designated time slot, so we are the few people the pigs can flock. When more patrons come in, then each person has one or two pigs on the lap.\n\nBeside looking cute due to their round, fat figures and round snouts, the pigs actually have personalities, some more feisty, some more gentle and some more clueless. They bond with each other and tend to stick with their favourite pig companions. They also love to huddle together, seeking for warmth and companionship.\n\nBy the way, there is complimentary chocolate coated donut for each patron, but it's more for filling the stomach rather than anything else.\n\nI really enjoy the experience, where I can understand these cute creatures a little bit more.\n\nThough it is also important to be realistic that the interaction with pigs will not be the same as with dogs since dogs are bred for thousands of years to behave like man's best friend. The pigs here already pleasantly surprise me by rushing up onto my lap, showing a certain level of friendliness and trust, which I think is amazing.\n\nI hope all of them will continue to be happy and healthy!\n\nThoughts: Interaction with Pigs is quite an Amazing Experience",
      "I loved this place! Such a fun and unique experience, you get to chill with the little micro pigs while enjoying a coffee. The café was super clean, and you can tell the piglets are well looked after and happy. It’s honestly one of those things you can’t really find anywhere else in the world.\n\nDefinitely make sure to book ahead, as they work on time slots and it can get busy. If you’re wandering around Harajuku and want to take a break, this is the perfect spot to relax and do something a bit different. Highly recommend! 🐷☕",
      "Came on a Sunday evening, it was really fun to pet the friendly pigs! They come to you on their own and lie on your laps with the blankets provided. They dont bite and they keep piling ontop of each other!🤣 new experience was unexpectedly fun :D",
      "Great experience. My cousin recommended this place to me when he visited this year so I had to come. Please not this location is like tucker in a corner so it's a short walk to find it. The worker who greeted us up front was so nice and patient. Then Julian inside was very insightful. The pigs were a hoot! Will be going again before we leave."

      "Meiji Jingu is located right in the heart of Tokyo, yet it feels like a completely different world. The grounds are surprisingly vast, and once you enter, you can truly feel the sacred and peaceful atmosphere. Despite the number of visitors, all you hear are birds while walking through the forest. The long walk to the main shrine is relaxing, and although the main temple area can be crowded, it’s still impressive to see. We were lucky to spot a wedding photoshoot near the couple trees, which made the visit extra special. Overall, it’s a beautiful and calming place to escape the city.",
      "Meiji Jingu is a place you can visit again and again. Even though there are many people walking around, it still feels peaceful and relaxing.\n\nThere is a long path leading to the shrine, lined with very tall, thick trees that make the surroundings beautiful and calming.\n\nWe went there in winter. Some trees had no leaves at all, while others still had dark green foliage. The pond was under maintenance and had no water in it. Even though it wasn’t the best season to show its full beauty, I was still very impressed. As I walked along the long path, I kept thinking about how it must look in spring or autumn.",
      "Beautiful scenery! No need to buy tickets or anything in advance unless you would like a detailed tour which we did not do. Walking from Harajuku station the shrine is directly outside one of the exits - very accessible. Lots of greenery which is a refreshing sight for Tokyo. Surprised to find out it was an active shrine and got to watch the priests walk out which was exciting! Many opportunities for photos as well as some souvenirs and omamori. Highly reccommend!",
      "A truly peaceful oasis in the heart of Tokyo. The long forest walk instantly calms you, and the shrine itself feels serene and powerful. Beautiful torii gates, meaningful traditions like ema and omikuji, and a sense of quiet reflection that’s hard to find in the city. Easy access from Harajuku, yet worlds away in atmosphere. Highly recommended—especially in the morning.",
      "This place is in the heart of Tokyo as well, the Meiji Jingu. I was surprised because the place is vast. When entering, you can really feel that you are inside of a sacred place. You can only here the sounds of the bird while walking even though there's a lot of people coming and going. The forest gives a peaceful vibes and I really liked it. The walk is long but when you reach the main temple, it is really crowded but still happy to see it. I was also interested at the couple tree and we were so blessed to see a wedding pictorial there. We also went to the Well. It has an additional maintenance fee but unfortunately we didn't see much because it is a seasonal based spot. Overall we enjoyed the walk."

      "Forget about Don Quijote , Bic Camera and all other taxfree souvenirs stores, THIS is where you need to start shopping before you leave.\n\nAs the name suggests this whole area is dedicated to Kitchenware, but it’s not limited to chopsticks and plates, it has also everything needed for restaurants, which means it also has plenty of decoration items that you will enjoy using at home or simply gifting to relatives.\n\nNot all stores are taxfree so make sure to ask before buying anything expensive.\n\nBut even those who aren’t will offer some high quality items that might be worth the full price.\n\nDo yourself a favor, hit Kappabashi before going to a shopping spree in Don Quijote.",
      "Come here to buy kitchen wares. Tourist area too surprising..guess many housewife, Top chefs from around the world like to come here for quality kitchen wares or its just cheaper. Iconic building with a large giant CHEF with top hat cannot miss it.\nBy the time we finished walking this street, it was sunset...beautiful. and local street food was already there open for business.",
      "Kappabashi Dōgugai is a long (800 m), specialised street between devoted almost entirely to kitchenware and restaurant supplies.\nFor more than a century it has served as the city’s professional culinary district, with shops selling everything from Japanese knives and ceramics to baking tools, bar equipment and the well-known plastic food replicas displayed in restaurant windows. Although its primary clientele are chefs and restaurateurs, many shops welcome individual visitors and offer items that are difficult to find elsewhere in Tokyo.\n\nThe street has its own rhythm: each shop is highly specialised, often run by long-established families, and the atmosphere feels more like a working district than a tourist area.\nDuring my visit I was especially pleased to find a shop dedicated entirely to noren, the traditional fabric curtains hung above doorways. I was able to buy exactly the pattern I had imagined, which made the walk through Kappabashi one of the most satisfying moments of the day.",
      "One of my favourite places in the city & probably on Earth.\n\nAmateur cooks & commercial restauranteurs will find every kitchen item possible. Ceramic dishware and other souvenirs even for those who hate cooking along the entire stretch. Niche kitchen equipment like strawberry leaf pluckers to explore. Non perishable food items. Etc etc etc. Each shop is stunningly well organized as well so you won’t waste time looking for specific items, just exploring the vast range of it.\n\nThis place is rare in that every time you go back, there is something new. Within walking distance of Senso-ji so it’s well located for the tourist travelling as well.",
      "Many many kitchen and restaurants related shops here, spend a good few hours here slowly waking along and going into multiple shops to have a look around. If you're looking for Japanese restaurants related items, here is the best place to come. It feels like all the Japanese restaurants come to this street to buy their signs, knives, dinnerware, bill book, ticket vending machine, uniforms, aprons and ect."

      "Just a short walk from Shinjuku Station, Omoide Yokocho (often called \"Memory Lane\") is an absolute gem. The alleyway is incredibly bustling and lively, packed with tiny eateries that give you a real taste of old-school Tokyo.\n\n​I especially loved the autumn decor and the glowing lights, it’s an incredible spot for photos, especially at night when the lanterns are lit up.\n\n​We stopped at one of the cozy stalls for curry rice and katsu, it was delicious.\n\nIt’s the perfect place to grab a bite, soak in the energy, and enjoy the nostalgic vibes.",
      "This short walking distance food alley look like for tourist.\nNo idea whether local people will visit here.\n\nBut is lively and prepare to wash your hair since the heavy grill smoke and almost every stall do the same thing.",
      "A maze of small restaurants and eateries.  They are all selling different types of Japanese food to both locals and tourists.\n\nSome do advertise they have English menus.\n\nJust as fun to walk through without eating anything.",
      "Our visit through Omoide Yokocho Memory Lane was so special! Absolutely adored walking through the alleyways and taking in the smells, ambiance, and energy. Plenty of options for meat and fish lovers (not so many vegetarian choices).\n\nMy husband and I visited 2 spots - Tsutsui (Japanese BBQ) and another spot with skewers. He LOVED the short rib at both, and I enjoyed my white rice and veggies (haha).\n\nOverall, it's a must visit during your Tokyo adventure! Plenty of nearby activities/signhts as well.",
      "Overrated insta-worth it, over glorified street food = tourist trap. If you don’t speak the language, be wary of hidden surcharges when ordering food. As a family of 4 with young children, we were not told of sitting fees (we still consumed beverages), and the staff was very coy /unclear about how the food ordering system worked. Ended up paying a hundred AUD worth for some tiny skewers (I’m a small eater and only I ordered for myself and my 7 year old who only had an couple of bites) and cans of orange juice (drinks are usually cheap in Japan). An absolute rip off. Yes the atmosphere is picturesque but not worth the over inflated pricing. We had been travelling in Nagano ans Mt Fuji and didn’t experience any of this. Only reason I rated 2 stars is because yes, it does look charming for a photo, and because the skewers were tasty (not worth 100aud though). Go spend your tourist $ elsewhere in Tokyo, plenty of better places !"

      "We went here as two people in the middle of January. There was plenty of available parking and a cozy café selling hot chocolate, which was nice after finishing the trip.\n\nThe location is beautiful, with many breathtaking scenic spots. The whole area is extremely photogenic, and there are plenty of monkeys to see.\n\nIt can be slippery due to ice forming on the pathway leading to the monkey hot spring, but you can rent shoe spikes before heading up.\n\nThere are quite a few people but getting pictures is still very doable.",
      "We took a 3.5-hour drive to Nagano, to reach Jigokudani Monkey Park. From the car park, we embarked on a 25-minute hike through a serene forest trail, surrounded by snow and crisp mountain air. At the end of the hike, we were rewarded with the view of Snow monkeys — Japanese macaques — soaking blissfully in natural onsen pools.\nIt was fascinating (and honestly quite adorable) to watch how the macaques enjoyed the warm waters, taking refuge from the winter cold, lounging like seasoned spa-goers.\nYou will need to purchase entry tickets (by cash or card) before entering the onsen area.\nThere are a couple of restaurants near the car park but these are usually packed with visitors.\nNonetheless, it's a refreshing escape into nature, and a truly memorable winter experience!",
      "An absolutely incredible experience.\n\nTickets were very affordable, and the walk up was well worth it.\n\nWe arrived right at feeding time, and it was unforgettable — a frenzy of monkeys running down the mountain all at once to eat. Watching around a hundred or so snow monkeys gather, interact, and feed was exhilarating and something I’ll never forget. Afterwards, seeing them relax and bathe in their little onsen was the perfect contrast — calm, beautiful, and uniquely Japanese.\n\nThe walk is about 1.6 km to the top. I did it on crutches and was completely exhausted, but it was worth every second.\n\nTruly a once-in-a-lifetime experience and a must-see when visiting Nagano.",
      "Travelled from Tokyo as a day trip to visite the Jigokudani Monkey Park.\n\nFrom Nagano station, I took a direct shuttle (¥3,000 one-way trip) to the base of the monkey park. You then proceed to hike up 1.8km through a beautiful forest pathways.\n\nAt the entrance of monkey park, the fee is ¥800 per adult. There was no wait on a Tuesday morning. Since the park is not very big, you will find yourself packed with all the other tourists around the main viewing platform (see photos).\n\nVery neat to see the monkeys lounge around, bathe and be in close proximity. It is quite touristy, and they are equipped with washrooms and a tiny heated gift shop/waiting area. In typical Japanese fashion, do not expect to be able to lounge or grab a bite to eat at the Monkey park (there are restaurants at the base of the park).\n\nCompared to other parks and temples where monkeys roam freely (Swayambhunath, Nepal and Lopburi, Thailand), the park was underwhelming. Always neat to see the monkeys and capture some great shots!"

      "Very nice factory shop with lot's more than parmesan. Bought some guianciale. But we came for the parmesan from the “Vacche Rosse” the old native breed Reggiana cow (aka “Red Cow”) of the Emilia-Romagna region. Really recomend this cheese and place. Friendly and helpful staff",
      "Excellent visit here today!\n\nThe cheeses they produce are wonderful. We sampled multiple months of aged cheese and the flavors are great.\n\nA very clean and organized facility. The tour was not comprehensive, as it didn't start from product receiving, but you can see the quality of what is being done there.",

      "⸻\n\nIt was truly an unforgettable experience taking the full tour with a guide named Giulia. She was incredibly generous with her time and explained everything to us in detail, answering every question with real knowledge and enthusiasm. Her English was excellent.\n\nThe shop is also beautifully curated — you’ll find some of the best local products, perfect for picking up a few special things to take home.

      "Do you like rivers? Do you like valleys? Do you like getting away from the big city? Do you like feeling secluded? This place is beautiful. It's not just the boat ride, there is so much to see. There are shrines, waterfalls, restaurants, etc. all in the area. The walk to boat's is a bit far so anticipate a good 20 minute walk. You can't actually row too far in the boats so don't worry, it's very safe and suitable for little children.\n\nAlso, remember, TAKE A DEEP BREATH. smell the air. It's what real air smells like. :)",
      "An incredibly beautiful place with dramatic cliffs, clear river water, and a very peaceful atmosphere. Walking along the paths and seeing the waterfalls was relaxing, and the scenery felt almost unreal. It’s a wonderful spot to slow down, enjoy nature, and take in one of Japan’s most iconic landscapes. Definitely worth the visit.",
      "I recently visited Takachiho Gorge and was amazed by the breathtaking natural scenery. The lush greenery, towering cliffs, and the stunning river views created a truly picturesque setting.\nI was surprised to learn that the formation of the gorge is related to Aso Volcano, which added an interesting geological aspect to the experience. The combination of nature's beauty and its volcanic origins made my visit even more fascinating.\nIt's a perfect spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts alike. I highly recommend taking the time to explore this beautiful location!",
      "About 15-20 min walk to the gorge after drop off by bus. A lot of tourists taking photos so walking is stop and go along the way. The trail is not hard but could be difficult for elderly and those with physical disability. Steep and many people walking down making pathway narrow, so best to take the shuttle van back up.\n\nNice views. Color of the water changes depending on the weather/sunlight. The river is not too long and height of waterfalls is not too high. Best picture spot is on the bridge.\n\n30 min boating ride; 2-3 riders, row on your own. Make sure you know how or else will have trouble when out in the water.\n\nThere are souvenir shops, restaurants, snack shops, and restrooms at the scenic spots.\n\nMango is the specialty there.",
      "Chan Brothers Tour – 23 November 2025\nAfter a delightful lunch at Aoshima Garden Dining, we continued our journey to explore the serene beauty of this region. The atmosphere was calm and refreshing, with gentle breezes carrying the scent of nature.\n\nOur next stop was a picturesque gorge, where the scenery unfolded like a painting—lush greenery, rugged cliffs, and the soothing sound of cascading water. We spent time near the little waterfalls, enjoying the tranquil rhythm of nature and even tried a bit of baiting along the clear streams.\n\nIt was a perfect blend of relaxation and adventure, a reminder of how simple moments in nature can create lasting memories."

      "🌿 A Hidden Gem of Nature and Calm\n\nIf you’re a nature lover or simply looking for a peaceful escape, this spot is absolutely worth visiting. The surroundings are breathtaking — a perfect blend of lush greenery, soothing sounds of nature, and that crisp, refreshing air that instantly calms your mind.\n\nThe blue ice cream and drink here are a must-try! They’re not just photogenic but also surprisingly delicious and refreshing after a bit of walking. It’s one of those small but memorable local touches that make the experience feel special.\n\nIt does get quite crowded, especially on weekends or around midday, but the best part is — you can easily find some quiet by taking a short walk away from the main area. Just a few minutes off the main path, the crowd thins out, and you can enjoy the serenity in peace.\n\nA short walk ahead leads you to a beautiful waterfall, surrounded by autumn-colored trees that turn the entire scene into a painting. The soft rustle of leaves, the sparkle of water under sunlight, and the cool mist in the air make it one of the most picturesque spots to sit, relax, and take it all in.\n\nWhether you’re here for a quick visit or a half-day adventure, this place is a perfect blend of natural beauty, peaceful corners, and seasonal charm. Bring a camera, comfortable shoes, and a sense of wonder — you’ll leave refreshed and inspired.",
      "This is one of those must-visit landmarks — the water is such a clear, stunning shade of blue that it completely captures your eyes. The autumn air was cool and refreshing, making everything around look even more vibrant. There’s also a small stream nearby, and the water there is the same beautiful blue. 💧🍁✨",
      "Shirogane Blue Pond (Aoiike) is truly a natural wonder. The water has an enchanting jade-like blue-green color that changes subtly with the light, giving it a magical, almost otherworldly appearance. Standing by the pond, you can see shades of turquoise, emerald, and sapphire blending together, creating a view that feels both calm and breathtakingly beautiful. Surrounded by trees and reflections, the scenery looks like a perfect painting. It is one of those rare places where nature feels pure, peaceful, and deeply mesmerizing.",
      "A very popular tourist spot in Hokkaido. However do be prepared that it doesnt not look as blue in real life. Most of the pictures you see online are have strong color filter I assume. Just by changing the lighting/filter of the camera you can achieve the results as well. Still a nice place to visit, there is the Shirahige waterfalls nearby as well that is worth visiting.",
      "✨ Absolutely Breathtaking! ✨\nShirogane Blue Pond is truly one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. The water is a mesmerizing, crystal-clear blue that looks almost unreal — like a painting come to life. The way the sunlight reflects off the surface creates a magical glow that changes with every angle.\n\nEven though it was quite cold this time of year, the view was still absolutely amazing — the crisp air actually made the colors feel even more vivid and refreshing. The peaceful, icy atmosphere gave the whole scene a quiet, dreamlike beauty.\n\nIf you’re visiting Hokkaido, bundle up and go! It’s serene, stunning, and completely unforgettable. 💙❄️🌿"

      "A very interesting place to visit, for both adult and kids alike. They have deers roaming around freely. You can feed them, pet them, but be careful when doing so, as they are not actually tamed/domesticated. You can buy snacks to feed the deers, which can be quite exciting once the deers start coming to you. All in all, worth coming here and making the time to really explore the whole place. So many places of interest to visit such as temples, shrines, parks.",
      "Don't stop at the first deer you see, there\nare lots and lots more!! The park is huge! Try not to be afraid of them,  show empty hands and they move on. The crackers are 200 yen for a stack of 5 or 6 crackers.  Break them into small bites and that will last you for a lot of deer visits.  Also, explore!! So many fun places outside of the park!",
      "🦌 I highly recommend to go to nara before 11 am!! You’d get to have some quality time with the deer (feeding them and taking pics in peace). So getting there around 10ish is fine. After 11 am it gets sooo crowded. ⏳\n\n🍪 deer cookies are 200 yen (cash only)! 💴\n\n🍦 The matcha flavored soft serve is so yum!! 😋 500 yen. They also have other flavors.\n\n🚉 accessible via public transportation from osaka & kyoto. No need to book a tour. Just seeing and feeding the deers takes 1-2 hours. You can have a bite or walk around (towards enchi garden) (+1-2 hours).\n\nOh!! Please don’t wear new shoes to Nara Park.. 🦌💩",
      "Nara Deer Park was one such place for me. As I walked through its wide green lawns, ancient stone paths, and softly whispering trees, I felt an instant calm settle in. And then, as if on cue, the stars of the park appeared—the graceful, free-roaming deer. Considered sacred in Japanese tradition and believed to be messengers of the gods, these gentle creatures move freely among visitors, unafraid and curious, adding magic to every moment.\nWhat made my visit truly special was the stillness. I sat down, simply soaking in the beauty around me, when a deer quietly wandered close—as if joining me in my peaceful pause. No rush, no noise, just shared silence and soft smiles. It felt like nature itself was reminding me to slow down, breathe, and be present. Moments like these don’t need grand words; they live in the heart.\nNara Deer Park is more than a tourist destination—it’s an experience of harmony between humans, animals, and history. Surrounded by ancient temples, open skies, and gentle hooves on grass, I left with a lighter heart and a deeper appreciation for life’s simple joys. Sometimes, happiness looks exactly like this: a quiet bench, a soft breeze, and a deer who chooses to share your moment.",
      "Great experience.\nMust see place if you are visiting Japan more than 10 days.\nAr the edge of city is national Park with hughe Forrest, tracks for walking, temples and untouched nature.\nThe most amazing is of course deers who are tame, approaching to people, waiting to be feed, sometimes like bagging for food and be around you till you have food for them.\nAnimals are not dangerous even mature  males have long and sharp horns.\nFood for deers you can buy from street sellers and is affordable."

      "A must-have on the bucket list for any dedicated fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki. Your first challenge is securing tickets—availability is extremely limited for non-residents, so you’ll need to plan at least two months in advance.\n\nDespite everyone having timed entry tickets, the check-in queue still took about 15 minutes.\n\nOnce inside, the museum was larger than I had expected and included a charming 15-minute mini-anime. The building and exhibits are incredibly cute and full of character. The café is decent, though quite busy.\n\nPhotography is strictly prohibited inside, and staff enforce this rule firmly.\n\nThere is very little information available in non-Japanese languages, and since we felt discouraged from taking out our phones to translate, we often found ourselves unsure of what we were looking at.\n\nNaturally, there are a couple of souvenir shops as well.\n\nOutside, there’s a pleasant park with picnic tables. My tip: arrive early and bring your own picnic.\n\nPlan ahead, get your tickets early, and enjoy being immersed in the magical Ghibli world for a couple of hours.",
      "If You’re a Studio Ghibli fan or even someone who enjoys creating animation, this is a must visit! I didn’t understand the hype until I experienced this museum, it’s truely a special place.\n\nSuper hard to land a ticket -I got the 4pm time slot because everything was sold within 30mins of tickets being available.\nGetting there wasn’t too tricky, you can walk through the beautiful Park or take a quick bus ride.\n\nNo Photos allowed inside is a little disappointing, but honestly I kind of liked that rule, it was great to see 0 people sticking their phones up to take photos/selfies of everything inside - photos wouldn’t do it justice anyway, you truely need to view the museum in person to appreciate it.\nBesides you can take pics with Totoro out the front of the Museum that’s good enough.\n\nThings are more in Japanese (understandably) but they do offer a few English items - map, book about the museum.\nThe Shop is Great! Lots of items unique to the museum that you won’t get anywhere else.\n\nI recommend visiting solo or with someone who loves & appreciates the art of Studio Ghibli",

The gardens are meticulously designed, and the combination of sand, moss, trees, and pathways makes the visit very peaceful.\n\nGetting there isn’t very easy by public transportation, so I arrived by Uber, which was very convenient. I visited in December around 10:00 am, and there were not many people, making the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nAfter exiting the temple, there’s a street lined with food stalls and souvenir shops that’s definitely worth exploring. It’s a nice way to extend the visit and take a relaxed walk afterward.\n\nEven though the pavilion itself is simple, the overall atmosphere and gardens make this place absolutely worth visiting, especially if you enjoy traditional Japanese gardens and a slower pace.",
      "Beautiful temple that is a little bit hidden from the city, kind of on the side, which means that it is not wall to wall with modern buildings. There is some kind of peace in the temple, it is quiet, you don't here cars or noise from the city. Beautiful garden with those amazing specially made gardens with sand and rocks which are racked in a specific way. There are fish in ponds which makes children love this temple. Like in almost all museum, temples or tourist attractions, there are toilets available which are clean, they are situated close to the exit and gift shop.",

      "This temple is a gem. It is truly remarkable, beautiful, and inspiring. It is also near many other temples, so it is possible to go to various temples in the area. This one is excellent.\n\nThe gardens are beautiful, to the point of being almost impossible to stop taking pictures. I feel like that is a reaction to wanting to soak it all in and keep it forever, and many fellow travelers were doing the same. It was raining some when I went and that honestly added to the atmosphere. The temple was very popular and there were many people out and about, but this did not impact my visit much. I would highly recommend a visit to this temple if you are in Kyoto.",

Unlike its gilded counterpart Kinkakuji, Ginkakuji was never meant to shine with metallic splendour; instead, its charm lies in its quiet grace, weathered wooden textures, and the gentle way it integrates with nature.\nVisitors often find themselves captivated not only by the pavilion itself but by the mesmerising clear pond that sits at its heart, known as the Kyōko-chi or “Mirror Pond.” Here, the stillness of the water forms a natural mirror that reflects the Silver Pavilion, surrounding pine trees, and shifting Kyoto sky. In moments of perfect calm, the pond creates the illusion of a floating temple—symbolising clarity of mind, serenity, and the harmonious relationship between humans and nature.\nThe beautifully landscaped garden, with its mossy paths, sculpted sand formations, guides visitors towards this pond as a meditative focal point. Ginkakuji continues to remind us that true beauty lies not in extravagance, but in stillness, reflection, and inner peace."

      "This was the second day of our trip with my partner, and since we had many spots planned, we set off very early in the morning. To be honest, the weather wasn’t great when we arrived at Fushimi Inari Taisha, but we were lucky enough to see a rainbow, which made the moment feel special.\n\nBecause it was still early, it wasn’t as crowded as we had imagined. We took photos along the way and tried various Japanese street foods. Halfway up the mountain, we even met other travelers like us and helped take photos for each other, which was a nice little interaction.\n\nBy the time we reached the top, the sky was no longer gloomy. Overall, it was a very enjoyable and memorable experience. If possible, I highly recommend coming early in the morning—it’s much quieter and allows you to enjoy the scenery at a relaxed pace.",
      "Fushimi Inari Taisha is one of the most magical places I’ve visited in Japan. The entrance is free, which is amazing considering how iconic this shrine is. Walking through thousands of red torii gates feels almost unreal, especially with the old Japanese shrine atmosphere and the quiet forest around it.\n\nIn front of the entrance, there are many food stalls selling Japanese traditional snacks and sweets, and also plenty of souvenir shops if you want to bring something home. It adds a lively local vibe before you enter the shrine area.\n\nI highly recommend coming early in the morning or later in the afternoon—midday gets very crowded and it can break the peaceful vibe. When it’s quiet, the place feels truly ancient and spiritual, almost mystical.\n\nEven if you don’t hike all the way to the top, the experience is totally worth it. A must-visit spot in Kyoto, especially if you love history, culture, and a slightly magical atmosphere.",
      "One of the most iconic temples in Kyoto with thousands of Orange Torii gates. I came around 7.45am in the morning, there are still no crowd so it's good time when you want to take photos comfortably. There are people here and there, but it's still manageable of you want to take photos without having them in your photos, you just gotta wait till they pass. But if you come later then it will be harder to take photos . As other temples in Kyoto this was a lot of stair and slopes and hike too, if you just wanna get a photo you can just walk through the Orange Gates until the first or second fork and turn around to walk back to the entrance. But for those who wish to get higher they may do so there will be another shrine at top and a view once you hile further up. I love the fox deities statues all over the temple.",
      "Fushimi Inari Shrine Kyoto is one of the most famous shrines in Kyoto, very iconic with the thousands of torii gates. If you visit Kyoto, this place is usually on top of the list.\n\nIt is very crowded, especially near the entrance area, so be prepared for many people. If you walk a bit further up, it becomes slightly less crowded and more enjoyable.\n\nThere are also many street food stalls around the entrance, so you can grab some snacks or drinks before or after walking. Quite nice to take a short break.\n\nOverall, Fushimi Inari Shrine is busy but still very memorable. Come early if you want better photos and calmer vibe.",
      "Japan’s one of the best tourist attractions. Gates bright colors attractive and beautiful scenic views. You can enjoy famous tokonamoyaki  street food if you can eat non veg though there are some sweet food spots also.street vibes was amazing. There are some shops which offers rental kimono also if you want to have e proper Japanese wear experience with family and  they have all the accessories and all size available for whole family. That was very nice experience you can have while in japan.must visit place 👍🏻"

      "The moment you catch the first glimpse of the Golden Pavilion reflecting on the mirror-like pond, it feels almost surreal. The combination of the shimmering gold leaf, the calm water, and the surrounding greenery creates a picture-perfect scene from any angle.\nThe walking path around the temple is easy and peaceful, with plenty of spots to pause for photos. Even with crowds, the atmosphere remains calm and respectful. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and the view looks stunning.\nThere’s also a small tea garden and a souvenir shop at the exit. The overall visit takes around 30–45 minutes, but the scenery leaves a lasting impression.",
      "Beautiful in every season. This place is timeless and well maintained. Definitely worth visiting. We arrived at 9:30am on the weekend and it was slightly already busy but not packed. I recommend coming early to avoid the tour buses.\n\nYou don’t need a tour guide for this. Pay 500 JPY on entry for an adult. It’s very easy to self navigate around the golden pavilion.",
      "Kinkaku-ji is truly breathtaking and one of the most beautiful sights in Kyoto. The Golden Pavilion shimmering against the surrounding pond and carefully manicured gardens creates a scene that feels both peaceful and unforgettable.\n\nThe walking path through the temple grounds is well organized and allows you to enjoy the pavilion from several stunning viewpoints, each more impressive than the last. Despite being a popular attraction, the area is well maintained and flows smoothly, making the visit enjoyable rather than overwhelming.\n\nThe combination of history, architecture, and natural beauty makes Kinkaku-ji a must-visit destination in Kyoto. It’s an iconic place that lives up to its reputation and offers a memorable glimpse into Japan’s cultural heritage.",
      "Kinkaku-ji 金閣寺 offers truly beautiful scenery and a very peaceful atmosphere. The golden pavilion reflected in the clear pond is lovely to look at, and the surrounding garden creates a relaxing feeling while you walk around. Every angle feels well composed, almost like a traditional painting.\n\nThe contrast of the golden temple with nature makes the view especially memorable, whether it’s the green trees of spring and summer or the gentle colors of autumn. It’s a wonderful place to take a quiet walk, appreciate Japanese architecture, and enjoy the calm surroundings.\n\nVisiting Kinkaku-ji is a pleasant experience and a great way to enjoy the natural beauty and cultural charm of Kyoto.",

Each viewpoint shows a different side of its beauty, from the shimmering gold surfaces to the harmony between the temple, water, and trees. The grounds also include smaller shrines, traditional structures, and scenic spots that make the visit even more enjoyable.\n\nEverything is well organized: the path moves smoothly, signs are clear, and the entire area is clean. It’s a comfortable stop for all ages and doesn’t require too much walking. Staff are helpful, and the experience feels well managed despite the crowds.\n\nKinkaku-ji fully lives up to its reputation. It’s a place where history, architecture, and natural beauty blend perfectly. If you’re visiting Kyoto, this landmark is absolutely worth your time—it’s a memorable highlight you shouldn’t miss."

      "Tokyo Tower is pure Tokyo nostalgia mixed with modern city vibes. In the daytime, it stands out beautifully against a clear blue sky, surrounded by greenery, temples, and skyscrapers — a perfect contrast of old and new Japan in one frame.\nBut at night… it’s on another level. When the tower lights up in warm orange and gold, it completely transforms the skyline. Calm, elegant, and incredibly photogenic. Whether you’re viewing it from nearby streets, a park, or from a distance with the city lights behind it, it never fails to impress.\nIt may not be the tallest tower anymore, but it’s definitely the most charming. There’s something timeless about Tokyo Tower — it feels romantic, cinematic, and unmistakably Tokyo.\nHighly recommend visiting both day and night if you can. Different moods, same magic. A must-see landmark that never gets old.",
      "Booked tickets to catch the sunset hour and it was very nice. Sadly it was a cloudy evening so there were no sightings of mt fuji. Good budget paid alternative observation deck, but if you want open air views, go to Shibuya sky instead. In Tokyo tower, you can add on for special access to 250m. Views were still spectacular though!",
      "Tokyo Tower is a timeless and iconic landmark that perfectly captures the charm of Tokyo. Seeing it up close is impressive, but the experience becomes truly magical at night when the tower lights up and glows beautifully against the city skyline.\n\nThe views from the observation decks are stunning, offering a wide panoramic perspective of Tokyo that feels both exciting and peaceful at the same time. The atmosphere is calm and enjoyable, making it a great place to take photos and appreciate the city from above.\n\nTokyo Tower isn’t just about the view — it carries a sense of nostalgia and classic Tokyo charm that feels warm and memorable. It’s a must-visit spot that leaves a lasting impression and a special feeling long after you leave. ✨🗼",
      "What a wonderful experience. The tower and surrounding areas are gorgeous. Easy walk from local hotels and several train stations.\n\nWe did the 250m tour during the day which was absolutely incredible and cost about $40 USD for two adults.\n\nLike everything else in Japan it was run efficiently and professionally with exceptional service.\n\nWe went on a clear day after it snowed the night before and you could see for miles and miles. Mount Fuji was clear as day.\n\nHighly recommend",
      "I purchased my ticket the same day and waited about 15 minutes for the tour. I purchased the upper deck tour, which also includes access to the lower deck. The full tour took about one hour.\n\nThe guide reviewed the history, and there was also a short video. While waiting, they offered complimentary drinks including apple juice, grape juice, wine, and water. The elevator ride to the upper deck had large windows, allowing us to see the city as we went up. There were bathrooms available on each level, which was very convenient.\n\nOutside of the tour, the ground level had public spaces with a market offering food and souvenirs. The location is easy to access by train, taxi, or on foot. Both decks had stunning 360-degree views of the city, making the experience even more memorable."

      "Beautiful centerpiece in Tokyo. Perfect to sightsee and get some good exercise while out and about. Check to make sure the park is open as it has very specific hours and is closed around some of the different holidays. You still are able to walk around it though and see many parts from the outside.",
      "We had the quick visit to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, and even though visitors can’t fully access the inner areas, the experience was still memorable. The palace grounds are beautifully preserved and give a sense of calm right in the middle of the city. The park is covered with vibrant green grass, neat bonsai trees, and wide open spaces that are perfect for a peaceful stroll. Standing there, you can see Tokyo’s modern buildings rising in the background, which makes the view even more scenic. It’s a quiet place that feels like a hidden pocket of nature in the heart of the city, even if you’re just visiting the outer grounds.",
      "This review is meant to the gardens around the palace. I couldn’t really find the palace itself, as all the trails that led to it were blocked. Some people say you can have guided tours twice a day to visit the exterior of the palace, so that might be an option, but I believe the palace itself is a newish building and unassuming.\nHowever, the gardens or park around the palace are huge, and you start to see some autumn colours (end of October 2025). I took a long walk there, and it was very peaceful. There are also toilets at various sites (I used the ones by the entrance next to Starbucks and they were clean; no paper towels or hand dryer though so bring a washcloth).\nI saw many people enjoying the good weather and just relaxing.\nSo I wouldn’t worry about the opening times of the palace (they might seem very strict), as I was, because you’re probable only going to visit the gardens anyway.",
      "Joined the morning tour of the palace grounds as a walk-in (essentially the first X number of visitors can get same-day tickets), though I believe tickets can also be reserved in advance online—they do go quickly.\n\nTour guides are volunteers and very knowledgeable about the grounds, its history, and the cultural significance of the architecture and landscaping. They also provide tours in several foreign languages, including English, French, and Chinese. We toured a main road, passing by the guard tower, imperial office building, on our way to the Imperial Palace. We viewed the Ironwork Bridge from a distance as it’s under restoration. The tour does not pass by the residence.\n\nThe tour takes about 90 minutes all said and done, bathrooms are available at the start and end, but not during. The entire tour takes place outdoors, so prepare for the weather.",
      "The Imperial Palace is a remarkably serene and beautiful place in the heart of Tokyo. The gardens are meticulously maintained, offering calm paths, elegant bridges, and stunning seasonal scenery. The harmony between traditional architecture and natural surroundings creates a peaceful atmosphere that feels worlds away from the busy city. The historic stone walls and moats add a sense of depth and significance, making every view picturesque. Visiting the Imperial Palace is consistently a rewarding experience and one of the most memorable highlights of Tokyo."

      "We went for fall foliage.  It was beautiful.  We didn't reserve the tickets.  In order to reserve tickets, you should do at least 2 days in advance.  We chose to ride the open-air car since we want to take pictures without the glare of glass on windows in the enclosed cars. Everything was well organized and ran smoothly.   Remember to bring a jacket, it's cold.  Because there is no reserve seats, if you want to have the  view fully, choose seat on the right side.  Because of the damage caused by the earthquake in 2024, the railway only runs between Unazukionsen Station and Nekomata Station.  It stops at Nekomata Station for 20 minutes. There is not much to do in Nekomata Station though.  I just wish the train ran at a bit slower speed at major attractions.  It wasn't fast, but I wanted to be able to \"feel\" rather than just passing by.",
      "No doubt about the gorgeous scenery but there's several negatives about the train ride. You better sit on the right side (facing forward) if you hope to get ANY views of the gorge and river as the left side faces the mountain side and it's dull all the way. The train does not turn around but only turns the seats around so you are on the same side going and coming back so if you're seated on the mountain side, sorry but you're stuck with watching trees and not much else. The company should assign seats so that the customers can be on both sides. Open cars are bench seats with sides open and protection from rain being pull down plastic sheets which blocks any chance of getting good views. Pay extra and get the covered cars which have pull down glass windows and cushions seats with heating underneath (well worth it) It rained steady on the return trip and I could still pull the window down for pictures without getting wet. The customers seated on the mountain side all looked bored very quickly and I don't blame them.",
      "20251107 gorgeous views of the autumn leaves!\n\nI like the open car way more, although we booked the close window (\"relax car\"). To feel the breeze and the smell of the forests. Beware of stinky bugs and loud noise thou (my friend is afraid of the bugs, but they fly away soon if you keep on moving, taking pictures).",
      "Extreamly beautifull view. But you have to be prepare that for the half of the ride you will be in tunels. If you sit on the wrong part of the train you won't have the best view. Sit on the right part when you departure and on the left when going back to base station. At the last stop you have about 20 minutes but there ist nothing to do and no good view so you can go to the toilet and sit in the train. There are station along the way but if you get off there is no garantee you will get in on the next train so its a bit risky. All in all its a great expirience and i recomend you going there.",
      "Great views, very brisk for fall, so bring a coat.  I would recommend concert ear plugs if riding in the open seat cars as the rails can be piercingly loud."

      "Kamikochi is absolutely breathtaking. The scenery is incredibly beautiful, with crystal-clear rivers, mountains, and forests that feel almost unreal.\n\nThe trails are very nice and easy to walk, making it perfect even for beginners or a relaxed hike. Everything is well maintained and clearly laid out.\n\nDo note that there are signposts warning about bears, so it’s important to stay alert and maybe bring your own bell 😆.\n\nYour experience depends a lot on the weather. On a clear day, the views are stunning, but clouds or rain can hide the mountains, so timing matters. Went here twice and the first was a winner while the last time, the clouds cover the mountains in the backdrop.\n\nOverall, it’s a must-visit place in Japan for anyone who loves beautiful scenery and peaceful nature.",
      "Visiting in November just before winter begins was an amazing experience. Along the trekking route to Kappabashi Bridge, you’re treated to breathtaking scenery.\n\nThe combination of icy mountain peaks, blue skies, and a crystal-clear river is truly a feast for the eyes.\n\nDon’t miss this place if you’re looking for fresh air and a peaceful atmosphere. A truly mind-calming experience.",
      "This national park is beautiful.  Suites everybody including small children and elderly people. We did the 9.2 km hike and there were some nice views. It's easy to walk. You can choose to hike there if you prefer. We started the walk early so we met a lot of people when we finished. The park is so large that there are trails in which I imagin you don't meet a lot of people. The entrance is banned for private cars so you have to park in a designated parking and take a bus from there and back. The bus can be busy so take it into consideration",
      "​We visited Kamikochi on the very last day before the winter closure and it was a truly an unforgettable experience.\nWe took the unreserved bus from Takayama, which was straightforward and convenient. We spent our day walking the trail towards Myojin Pond. The path is well-maintained and offers stunning views of the Azusa River and the Alps. The scenery is world-class and it’s a perfect day trip for anyone staying in the Gifu/Nagano area.\n​Tip: If you're traveling here, just be mindful of the bus schedules back to Takayama/Matsumoto to ensure you don't miss the final departure!",
      "Very beautiful place. I didn't manage to catch the peak of the autumn foliage in early October but there was some parts that turned colour and the blend of colours was beautiful too. Cool weather was nice for a hike. Many monkeys around who were absolutely not afraid of humans, just living their lives as if we are invisible, quite a fun sight to see."

      "The next time I visit Japan, I’m 100% coming back here. Walking into this store felt pretty awesome — there’s such a nostalgic vibe for any Jordan or basketball lover. They have so many exclusive items you can’t find anywhere else, and the prices are actually really fair. You can even customize certain Jordan’s, which I highly recommend - as it’s exclusive to the store and serves as a memorable souvenir! The whole Jordan team was so kind and attentive, and the energy in the store was just so amazing. I got helped by Yuta, and he was the best! Super friendly and easy to talk to — we ended up chatting about his favorite U.S. artists, food spots he wants to try someday, and even places he recommended in Japan. Everyone here made me feel so special. 10/10",
      "I passed by the World of Flight in Shibuya on a weekday. To be honest I liked this place more than Nike’s Harujuku store. The staff was also very helpful in helping me customize a few World of Flight t-shirts that were exclusive to this location. I just wish I had more time to explore the store.",
      "Nice entrance, big store, if you are a fan of Jordan make sure you check out this place. I was hoping for some exclusives, did not have anything like that. Nice Jordan wall though.",
      "The store is huge and the associates are polite and very helpful. There are lots of stuff to select for and they do customization. Just want to give a shoutout to Hizuke, Moana, Itoha, Haku, Lani, Bella, and Lucas for being so nice and very patient of answering our queries. You guys rock! 💕 #teamDubai",
      "It's like I died and went to heaven at this store!! I lost a Jordan pendant off one of my shoes years ago and never thought I'd be able to buy a replacement but I found it here! Service was impeccable and prices for products were super reasonable. Staff are so friendly. The decor and history posted about M.J is amazing as well"

In addition to Miharashi Hill, there are several other fields of flowers of various colours as well.\nGetting here from Katsuta Station is just one bus ride away.

Has lots of various activities, from a simple picnic, bike riding, and a mini theme park. Even just enjoying the beautiful vista is already joyful.\nIt’s almost 2 hours from Tokyo Station by train and continued with a local bus from Katsuta Station (appr. 17 minutes).\nPlenty of food and beverages vendors inside, but be prepared for the lines during weekend/holidays.",
      "It was nice but not as expected, not like what it looks in the ad or pictures online so lower your expectation.\nThough, they have a large variety of plants and flowers which are distinctive for each season so you can come at anytime.\nIts a huge place, they not only have gardens but also an amusement park. The place has its own food stands so you dont have to prepare food in advance but idk ab the price.",
      "Hitachi Seaside Park is famous for its blue nemophila that bloom between mid-April and  May. And the red kochia trees after mid-October.\n\nIt offers many attractions with entertainment. Such as golf putting, biking, and other things for everyone.\n\nThis was our first experience in this beautiful part. We enjoyed the cute red trees that transformed into a red color. We liked the rides in the amusement park as well.\n\nHowever, it would be nice if all the information were given a little bit more clearly.\n\nFor example, the Ferris wheel. We were in line at the Ferris wheel for about 10-15 minutes already until we saw someone cut the line. We realized that we were in the wrong line.\n\nMoreover, the information for the one-day pass option for unlimited amusement rides should be at the entrance.\n\nOne complaint is that all the paper tickets you need are inconvenient to hold on to and use.\n\nWe held six different tickets while visiting the park.  Perhaps if they combine all the tickets into one, everyone will benefit from this in the future.\n\nA small reminder, this place is near the ocean. That means there are strong winds so I would suggest that you bring a warm jacket with you.",
      "Breathtaking flower paradise!\nHitachi Seaside Park is absolutely stunning — a must-visit for nature and photography lovers. The seasonal flowers, especially the blue nemophila in spring and red kochia in autumn, create incredible views that look like a painting. The park is wide, clean, and beautifully maintained, perfect for walking, cycling, or just relaxing in nature. A peaceful and unforgettable day trip from Tokyo!"

      "The Shirato Falls are worth a climb down and back up the stairs! They are beautiful and on a sunny day you can see multiple rainbows hovering in front of them. When travelling here by car try to avoid the men waiving you toward their car parks. Prices for parking range from ¥150 up to ¥500 for a normal car. But you can park for free if you go slightly further from the falls.\nAlso, from some points you can catch the Shiraito Falls and Mt. Fuji in one photo shot.",
      "We drove from tokyo, north around fuji stopping at places along the way, including Shiraito Falls. There is a 500 yen charge to park your car but plenty of space. A short 1-1.5km loop with great views. Small shops and food stalls, surprisingly well priced, on the walk down. Visited in early December so many of the autumn leaves had fallen but still plenty of green. Well kept paths but be prepared for a few stairs, some being a bit steep. If you are already doing the loop around fuji, add this to the list.",
      "We visited Shiraito Falls on a cloudy and rainy day, but despite the weather, it turned out to be such a memorable experience for all seven of us in the family. The soft drizzle actually made the surroundings feel more magical as the mist from the falls blended beautifully with the fog, giving the whole place a dreamlike atmosphere. The sound of the cascading water was so soothing, and the lush greenery around us looked even more vibrant under the rain.\nWhat made the visit even more special was that, just for a brief moment, the clouds parted and we caught a glimpse of Mount Fuji in the distance. It felt like a small gift from nature after waiting patiently in the rain. The walking paths were easy to follow, though a little slippery, and we took our time enjoying every view along the way.\nEven with wet shoes and umbrellas in hand, we couldn’t help but smile. There was something peaceful about being surrounded by nature, hearing the water roar, and feeling the cool mist on our faces. Shiraito Falls truly lived up to its name as one of Japan’s most beautiful waterfalls, rain and all.",
      "So beautiful! This place took me totally by surprise with its beauty. Lots of tourists here but fir a good reason and if you decide the walk into the park you'll barely see any tourists there and the views are fantastic. The scenery around the waterfalls is breathtaking.",
      "A beautiful sight which you can only dream of seeing. This lovely view, with several waterfalls. Was able to experience a rainbow at the center of all the waterfalls.\n\nThe serene walk from the street, coupled with several little shops with roasted chestnuts, and souvenirs. Leading to several stone stairs leading down to the bridge where you can view the lovely waterfalls from afar. Once coming close up to them, you a fresh mist of water and a breath of fresh air blasting your nose.\n\nAfter several pictures, there is a path with stairs leading up to one of few viewing decks, where you can see through the many colorful trees, a view of Mt. Fuji-san. A view you can only see in pictures and post cards.\n\nThe cool air brought a joyous feeling to our faces, and would recommend family, friends, and couples to definitely visit."

      "So this review is on the hotel, not cinema.  When leaving the East exit from Shinjuku station, you only have to walk straight about 500m to the hotel, super easy to find.  When you enter, the lobby is on the 8th floor and the elevators only stop one the 1st and 8th floors.  The hotel lobby is very clean with a lot of decor.  There is a sweet Godzilla display with Godzilla and three other monsters.\n\nChecking in was very easy.  I was so lucky to be able to have Godzilla room on the 30th floor.\n\nThere is a Godzilla theme bar if that is your flavor as well in the lobby\n\nThe terrance to go out and see the Godzilla head is/was closed so to \"issues\".  My gut feeling is stupid people were climbing on the head to take pictures.  So right now you can not go out there.  Still really cool to see.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not going to talk about what my room looks like.  The surprise is worth it.  I recommend not seeing too many pictures of the room so you can get the true experience.  I can say the room was very clean, and fun to be in.\n\nWould I stay here again?  Yes, however the only downfall is the location from the airport.  If your final destination is this hotel, getting back to the airport can be a pain if your using public transportation.  If you taxi, your looking at about 11,000 yen.  Trust me that is worth it if you have a lot of luggage.\n\nFor folks that want to do the experience, so it.  If you can get any of Godzilla theme rooms, do it.  You only live once.",
      "Had an absolute blast here! Went to see Tron: Ares cause was listed as Sub (So knew it would be in English). The concession prices were fair, and they had a little scoopable candy option! Made a fun movie candy mix! Seats were comfortable enough, and the gift shop had some awesome classic movie gifts! Plus the view from the window was quite awesome! And Godzilla was next door!",
      "Great option to watch your favorite movie while eating the classic popcorns and your favorite drinks. (I recommend the set combo for two so that you can enjoy both caramel and salty popcorn)Clean and comfy the facilities are upstairs. Book in advance!",
      "It's a large cinema complex with Godzilla! It offers great location and many movies in different formats. They also serve food and drinks including alcoholic drinks. You should book a seat before you go and can be very busy.",
      "Well organized Cinema! We watched the new Demon Slayer Movie!⚔️ HINOKAMI KAGURA🔥🔥 I enjoyed the overall experience. We even got a little present from the movie!!! The seats are a bit narrow tho. If you're from a western country you'll immediately feel the difference especially if you're over 180cm. If the movie is over 2h it might get a tiny bit uncomfortable The quality of the Projectors are top notch and it's nice to see that everyone respects the rules and is quiet even tho the theater was completely filled."

      "This Onsen was the highlight of our Japan trip. We went the first week of November at the peak of fall colors and I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. Our room was right above the river and we had such a good view. The indoor and outdoor baths were clean and lovely to enjoy. I could not give this location a higher recommendation. The service and respect from the staff was top notch and we really enjoyed staying there. Having everyone in Yukatas was an added bonus - really added to the theme.\n\nSome notes as mentioned in other reviews:\n1)They only serve breakfast and dinner so you'll want to either bring cash to buy some ramen from the gift shop or bring some food in for lunch.\n2)Yes they could dust more and get of some of the cobwebs on the ceilings. I'm tall and there were many short beams and ceilings I had to duck under. Hit my head a fair amount of times and had some cobwebs in my hair lol\n3)They do not have western style beds and you sleep on a few tatami mats with comforters. I don't have an issue with these sleeping arrangements, but just something to note if you are more comfortable sleeping on softer surfaces\n\nOverall - very relaxing and enjoyable experience. I would recommend going in fall/winter to avoid bugs (Nov - Mar).",
      "WORTH THE PRICE & JOURNEY!\n\nThe Osenkaku located in the mountains of the Gunma, is one of the best traditional Inn i stayed in. From flawless pickup and welcome to winsome food and customer service, its a place where one would definitely come back again.\n\nHaving a checkin at 4pm, the hotel provide complimentary from the nearest JR Local (Minakami) & Shinkansen (Jomokogen) stations beforehand; the gentleman bus driver found us (Grp of 5) from inside the ticketing area of the station and guided us to the bus. At the Hotel, we were welcomed by the staff where checkin was doing along with a introduction to the Onsen, its rules & other facilities. The staff promptly helped with any basic queries as it was our first time in a Japaneses Onsen; along with helping in choosing the right Yukata and coat. Later too, they will make the beddings too when the guests are having the Dinner.\n\nThe Hotel itself is quite huge and have certain area which are not disable-friendly; since its quite old but well maintained. The Onsen is connected with a bridge where there are common pools and a dedicated pool for women. Bathrobe (suited for 6ft+) for the pool is provided and there are gendered changing rooms, showers and dryers available too next to onsen pools.\n\nThe Meals are quite exquisite and extensive Japanese items. Prior arrangements is made for any allergies. All the meals are served in the Restaurant.",
      "beautiful and amazing trip with family. we came just in time to see the beautiful autumn foliage. as its my first time being in japan in autumn, and coming to the countryside outside of major cities like tokyo, this was such a beautiful retreat from the hustle and bustle of rhe city. the onsens were wonderful and mixed gender public onsen was great for family time! while the gender separated ones were perfect for some personal time relaxing after a long day of travelling and exploring the region. Of course, in true japanese hospitality style, we enjoyed delicious meals (we stayed for 3 days) for breakfast and dinner — everyone in our family, both young and old, enjoyed it greatly. Its definitely a trip to remember!",
      "Social media promotes this place well. There are four outside baths, three mixed and one female only. The shower rooms aren’t near the baths. I am not certain that anyone washes up when it is freezing cold out; it just isn’t really feasible. You are required to wear bathing garments in the mixed bath. At my visit, all of the women were wearing garments in the outdoor female bath. The indoor bath was nicer for me, didn’t need to trek in the cold, and had the standard bathing facilities… garments were prohibited. The scenery is wonderful in the area. The food was on par with other ryokans.\n\nThe walk to the outdoor baths is uncomfortable when it is freezing cold outside.\n\nThis is still the place to stay if you want to visit this area.\n\nI spent one night here, 12/29/25.",
      "You cannot beat the view and onsen. It’s stunning (just a bit colder than I wanted). This is not the “local Japanese ryokan” experience I was looking for, though. It was 95% tourists/non-Japanese and catered for it. Food was good, but mild as a result and the signs everywhere bossing us around were kinda of a lot and entirely in English. The room was spacious, but just very old. Indoor bathes and outdoor changing rooms need a touch up. It’s perfect for a couple, though. I would not recommend for a family or solo traveler."

      "About a 10 minute wait once you arrive.\nYou have to watch a quick video and how to go through the exhibits, that the rooms change and theres no path, you go at your own pace.\n\nWe enjoyed it a lot, spent about 4 hours in there and we still somehow couldn't find the Tea Room. I started to get Zenn'ed out but my partner loved it. There is a small resting area, and a water refill station by the bathrooms if you have a refillable water container.\n\nAmazing displays. Only bothersome thing was the parents who let their kids run wild, screaming and damaging the displays. Staff would ask them nicely to not pull and bend pieces but the kids would ignore it to the point I was starting to get upset, as well as a few others trying to enjoy the displays.\n\nWould recc as its a fun first experience and the artistic setups and displays were just amazing. My videos and pictures don't showcase it well enough.",
      "TeamsLab Borderless was an experience that played into your sense of sight, touch, and hearing. If you want a full experience, it is encouraged to download the app, which has more information on each respective room and pieces. True to its name it’s really borderless, as you’ll see the different art pieces go into different areas to create unique circumstances. Some pieces also made me feel small as there seemed no end to it!. With art pieces drifting to different areas, this means you’ll experience something new as you revisit rooms.\n\nI went with some friends around 2:30 PM on a Monday. It was pretty busy at that time. We spent about 1.5 hours here at a moderate pace of exploring and revisiting spaces. I had a great first time experience and would love to revisit in the future.",
      "An amazing place you MUST go! You will have a totally new and unforgettable experience. There are many rooms in the place, each has its special lights and music, some are so addictive, I can stay there and watch the lights keep changing to lots of different gorgeous pictures for whole day.\n\nEveryone is so enjoyable, no matter kids or adults. You can miss senso-ji, but you can’t miss this!",
      "We booked same day for 330-4pm entry timeslot.  The mall in which this installation is located is large but there are clear directions everywhere to find teamLab.  We took advantage of the free lockers to store our winter coats.  We waited a short while before watching a mandatory video (rules, safety) before entering.\nWe enjoyed our time here although it was quite busy - Sunday afternoon is probably not ideal!  - especially if you want to take photos without some stranger appearing in the photo.\nWe did not experience the tea room as the online booking option was not available (sold out).we stayed between 1-1.5hours.  It’s something I can go to again easily as I didn’t see all the art work - each room will have different art at different times, so you are encouraged to return to rooms/areas you have already visited.",
      "Absolutely breathtaking and unforgettable\n\nteamLab Borderless at the MORI Building was truly an unreal experience. From the moment you step inside, you’re completely immersed in a world of light, color, and movement. Every room felt like a living piece of art…constantly changing and flowing, so no two moments felt the same.\n\nWhat I loved most is how interactive and limitless it felt. There’s no set path, which makes the experience feel personal and exploratory, like you’re discovering something new at every turn. The visuals were stunning, calming.. definitely a place where you can slow down and really be present.\n\nPictures don’t even do it justice. This is a must see if you’re visiting Tokyo and enjoy art, technology, or unique experiences that stay with you long after you leave. I would 100% go again."

      "Arashiyama was absolutely beautiful during our visit in late November, right in the peak of momiji season. The combination of colorful autumn leaves, the calm river, and the iconic scenery around Togetsukyo Bridge created a very peaceful and scenic atmosphere.\n\nWalking through Arashiyama with my wife and kids felt relaxed and enjoyable. The area is spacious, stroller-friendly, and offers plenty of spots to slow down, take photos, and enjoy nature together. From the bamboo grove to the riverside views, everything felt timeless and memorable—one of the highlights of our family trip to Japan.\n\nMaaf kalau a",
      "Arashiyama is a beautiful escape from the busier parts of Kyoto—peaceful, scenic, and full of nature and culture. While most people rush straight to the Bamboo Forest, I personally felt it was skippable, especially if you’re visiting during peak hours. The bamboo path is iconic in photos, but in reality it can get crowded quickly, and the experience feels a little rushed.\n\nWhat truly makes Arashiyama special, in my opinion, are its temples and surrounding nature. Places like Tenryū-ji, Jōjakkō-ji, and Nison-in offer a far more tranquil and meaningful experience. The temple grounds are beautifully maintained, rich in history, and surrounded by stunning seasonal scenery. Walking through these places gave me a sense of calm that the bamboo grove didn’t quite deliver.\n\nThe Katsura River area is another highlight. The gentle flow of the water against the backdrop of mountains makes for an incredibly relaxing stroll, perfect for photos, snacks, or just soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nArashiyama is full of charming streets, traditional sweets, and little shops worth exploring. But the real gems are the quieter corners- temple gardens, forested pathways, and scenic viewpoints that let you enjoy Kyoto’s beauty at your own pace.\n\nOverall, Arashiyama is definitely worth visiting, but I’d recommend skipping the Bamboo Forest crowds and spending more time at the temples instead. You’ll get a more peaceful, authentic, and memorable experience. 🍁🌿✨",
      "Very nice and relaxing bamboo forest place.  This little cute and chill town has this bamboo forest that is well known worldwide, it is such greenery and make you completely relax walking through it walk pathways - it’s not long, I would say about 30mins and you could covered all of it pathways.  There is alway a pathways just for jinrikisha (traditional Japanese carriage) quite nice and romantic too.  There is a burial site and I guess a temple within it.  Also there is a railroad and once in awhile you can see a rain speeding by. It’s definitely a picturesque place and yes tourist is high here.  Once you’re done, you can so spend time walking around the town with shops, street snacks, restaurants, coffee shops, temple, cross over the river for more shops, cafe, etc.  very lovely and relaxing little town with lots of tourist for sure but still keeping the tradition culture for sure.  Got to love the Japanese.",
      "Bamboo forest is good place to visit. Can be crowdy and the pathway is a little rocky (gravel). The walk to the bamboo forest isn't long, you might stumble across one of the pokemon manhole, which I did. Fairly easy location to travel to from Osaka/Kyoto.",
      "One of my favorite places in Japan. The scenery in all seasons are just amazing. Was here several times in Spring during full Sakura bloom and now in fall for the colors. Amazing. Can’t possibly explore the whole area in a day."

      "We love our experience here. The staff always treat us with so much warmth. We started off with making our own cup noodles. It was 500 yen each,you can buy up to 3 cups per person. You will be ushered to start your drawing and then pick your desired ingredients and soup flavours. After they will pack it up,and you vacuumed it into your own take away bag. Super cute. I think we got really lucky, the staff gave us an opportunity to do the chicken ramen experience.(1000 yen per pax) The whole duration took 70 mins but it was the best experience. Heard from the staff that spots are limited and need prior reservations. When enter the room in level 2, you get to change to apron and a cute chick bandana. The staff was so patient and lovely in guiding us step by step on how to make the ramen. If you have young children, this will be a very educational and fun experience for the little ones. 🩷 I truly enjoy my time.",
      "A wonderful blast from the past! Got to customise my own cup noodle that came with choice of dried ingredients and a soup base.\n\nPaid for the ramen-making workshop too which was quite interesting. Got to make the noodles from scratch. Great hands-on activity for children. It would be good to get the tickets first upon arrival at the museum.",
      "Fun activity in Osaka and a must visit. This place has something for every age group.\n\nThe first floor has numbered cup noodle exhibits. The numbers help you navigate an online audio tour to learn more about each exhibit.\n\nAt the end of the exhibits is an area where you get a personal cup noodle container from a vending machine for 500¥, which you can design and color as you like. At the end you take the container to the final section where they put in the noodles, add seasoning (you get to select 1 from the 4 available seasonings), add some toppings (you get to select 4 from all available toppings), then seal and shrink wrap it. You get to place your own cup noodles in an inflated bag to carry as a souvenir.\n\nOn the second floor, you get to make your own ramen. It's an interesting experience where they walk you through each step of the process. At intervals when the dough is left to rest and the noodles are being fried, you get to design and color your ramen packets. The entire session is very well organized and time driven. You need an advance reservation for this experience, costs 1000¥ per person and needs to be done in pairs.\n\nThis museum is a very nice way to preserve and remember the legacy of the inventor of cup noodles, and to impart the underlying principle in visitors that even the simplest ideas can change the world if you pursue it with conviction.\n\nThe only thing i did not like about this place is that there is no dining area in the museum (even though one presentation mentioned that there is one where you can try out some cup noodles). It would be fun to try out some tasty cup noodles after spending about 2.5 hours in the premises.",
      "Our teenage kids (13 and 14) both had fun decorating their noodles! We are cup noodles people and this experience was enjoyable for us as a family. No need for reservations. Just go in and register and pay for the cup you will be decorating (500yen per cup). For the noodle making though, it needs advance reservations and at this time (Oct 30), the next available slots are December already!\n\nPlace is not that big so we finished in an hour. It was quite organized and instructions are also written. There were staff too to guide you for the next step. After decorating, you’ll line up to choose your ingredients and soup base.\n\nThere were not many people though there was a school kindergarten students who were having their trip hete which was so cute.\n\nThere is also a room where you can sit and watch a video. Unfortunately, the video is in japanese so we couldnt quite understand. After the noodle making, there is an exhibit outside which also do not have english. There is however an audio guide you can listen to when you scan the qr code.\n\nNoodles has expiration date of 1 month.\nWhat a unique experience of decorating your own cup noodles. I am sure the kids would love doing it.",
      "This was a great surprise as it was very fun and exciting even for adults, the day I went there were more adults than children at first there was a hands on experience decorating your own pot noodle pot before choosing the contents. Highly recommend for anyone and everyone to visit. The museum itself is small but extremely interesting."

      "Really great experience. The tour guide Sayo was so good. Her English was great and she was very engaging and funny with her storytelling, yet very informative. My husband and I learnt a lot from this museum. Part of the tour included throwing the ninja stars as well, which was fun. They also give you an opportunity to dress up as samurai or ninja at the end of the tour included in the cost.",
      "The Samurai Ninja Museum was so good! Our tour guide Maya was amazing, super knowledgeable, funny and lovely! A very insightful and interesting experience into Japans history. Very fun and cool! Highly recommend! Thankyou for the shuriken! Thankyou Maya!",
      "Great experience!!! The employees are very friendly and engaging. The sword samurai experience was really cool and epic, got to learn the way of a samurai. Shout out to Kubo-san for teaching us the way. Then the museum tour was very insightful and also engaging. Tao-san made it very fun to watch and listen to. Would recommend!!",
      "We had such an amazing time visiting the Ninja Museum in Kyoto! Our tour guide, Ms. Yuki, was fantastic, very friendly and knowledgeable. She explained so much about the history of samurai and ninjas, and we learned a lot during the tour.\n\nThe best part was getting to experience being a ninja ourselves! We got to try throwing the ninja star weapons (shuriken), which was really fun. The kids especially loved it, they even got to dress up in ninja and samurai costumes.\n\nOverall, it was a fun and educational experience for the whole family. Highly recommended if you’re visiting Kyoto!"

      "Visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was not that crowded.\nHad a stroll uphill with autumn leaves around.\nThe slope path was shared with cars so be careful.\nIf you take the stairs, it’s faster but quite uneven.",
      "I visited Gujo last week, as well as almost exactly one year ago. And despite it not being an original castle, I very much love this one as much as the original 12 because they have rebuilt the interior out of wood instead of concrete.\n\nThe walk around the outer wall is so gorgeous, as well as the views from the tower. Staff are always wonderful and the parking lot right next door is free. What more could you ask for?",
      "The Castel is very well preserved.  It is a small one compared to the Himeji Castel. It has a museum inside but only in Japanese.  The artifacts showed are interesting and well preserved and the views are beautiful.\nThere is a parking place close to the Castel if you dare to drive the uphill very narrow road that is one way.",
      "The walk towards the castle was fun. I thought the castle was fully renovated but not really. It’s still wood with creaking noises. 🤭 The view from the castle was great too. Definitely gonna visit Gujo Hachiman in a different season.\n\nThere’s a souvenir shop and a snack bar outside the castle beside the ticket booth.",
      "I am usually not interested in visiting castles, but this one seemed to have a really nice view of Gujo town, so here we were.\n\nThe visiting route is well thought out, with signs pointing out popular photo spots along the way.\n\nWe drove up to the castle grounds where there is free parking. The road is very narrow, so you have to watch out for pedestrians. The parking can get full, but traffic is well controlled at the parking lot, and we waited a bit for a space.\n\nThere is a small fee to enter the castle, and it is worth it because the view from inside is even nicer."
